# Review checklist for SME validation
review_tasks:
  - "Verify retention patterns capture both absolute and relative time periods"
  - "Confirm deletion patterns distinguish self-service vs email-based requests"
  - "Validate access rights patterns capture DSAR/CCPA request language"
  - "Check waiver patterns don't over-trigger on legitimate security disclosures"
  - "Test against GDPR Article 15-17 language samples"
  - "Validate weights using gold dataset precision/recall metrics"
