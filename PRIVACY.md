# Privacy Policy â€” Terms Guardian (MVP)

Terms Guardian is designed privacy-first. In the MVP release:

- All analysis runs locally in your browser: readability, rights scoring, summarization, uncommon terms
- No network requests are made for analysis
- The extension stores minimal data locally using Chrome storage for settings and cached results
- You can clear the local cache at any time

## Data we process

- Page text: processed in-memory to compute scores and summaries
- Cached analysis artifacts: optional, stored locally to improve performance
- Settings: your preferences for diagnostics and privacy

We do not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data.

## Permissions

- activeTab: required to read and analyze the current page content
- storage: used to store settings and local cache

## Future features (opt-in)

If we introduce optional cloud-backed caching or model updates, they will:

- Be disabled by default (opt-in only)
- Be clearly documented in the Settings UI and this policy
- Minimize transmitted data (e.g., content hashes instead of raw content), when possible
