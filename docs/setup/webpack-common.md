Your `webpack.common.js` file is designed to handle the common configuration for your web browser extension application. Below is a detailed documentation of this configuration:

### Entry Points

The configuration defines multiple entry points for different parts of your application:

- `serviceWorker`: The background service worker, located at `./src/background/serviceWorker.js`.
- `content`: The content script for interacting with web pages, located at `./src/content/content.js`.
- `sidepanel`: The entry point for the side panel, located at `./src/panel/sidepanel.js`.

### Output

The output configuration specifies how the bundled files should be named and where they should be placed:

- `path`: The output directory is set to `../dist`.
- `filename`: The output files will be named based on the entry point names, e.g., `serviceWorker.js`.
- `clean`: Ensures the output directory is cleaned before each build.

### Module Rules

The module rules define how different types of files should be handled:

- `.js` files: Transpiled using Babel with the `babel-loader`.
- `.css` files: Extracted using `MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader` and processed with `css-loader`.

### Plugins

Several plugins are used to enhance the build process:

- `CopyPlugin`: Copies various files and directories to the output directory.
  - `manifest.json`: Copies the manifest file and injects the version from the `npm_package_version` environment variable.
  - `sidepanel.html`: Copies the side panel HTML file.
  - `images`: Copies the images directory.
  - `dictionaries`: Copies the dictionaries directory.
- `MiniCssExtractPlugin`: Extracts CSS into a separate file named `styles.css`.

### Summary

Your `webpack.common.js` configuration is set up to handle the common build tasks for your web browser extension. It defines entry points for the service worker, content script, and side panel, and uses plugins to manage the manifest file, HTML files, images, and CSS extraction. This configuration ensures that your assets are properly bundled and copied to the output directory, making it ready for deployment.
