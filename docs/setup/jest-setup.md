Your `jest.setup.js` file is designed to configure the testing environment for your JavaScript-based web browser extension application using Jest. Below is a detailed documentation of the setup:

### Imports

- **`@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect`**: Extends Jest with custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
- **`setupChromeEnvironment`**: A custom function to set up the Chrome environment for tests.
- **`setupMockAnalyzers`**: A custom function to set up mock analyzers for tests.

### Setup Test Environment

The `beforeAll` hook is used to set up the test environment before any tests run:

- **Mock `window.matchMedia`**: Defines a mock implementation for `window.matchMedia` to simulate media queries.
- **Mock `window.ResizeObserver`**: Defines a mock implementation for `ResizeObserver` to simulate resize observations.
- **Mock Timing Functions**: Uses Jest's fake timers to control the passage of time in tests.
- **Setup Chrome Environment**: Calls `setupChromeEnvironment` to set up the Chrome environment.
- **Setup Analyzers**: Calls `setupMockAnalyzers` to set up mock analyzers.
- **Mock Console Methods**: Mocks `console` methods to prevent actual logging during tests.

### Reset Mocks Between Tests

The `afterEach` hook is used to reset mocks and clear storage between tests:

- **Clear All Mocks**: Clears all mock functions.
- **Clear All Timers**: Clears all fake timers.
- **Clear Local Storage**: Clears `localStorage`.
- **Clear Session Storage**: Clears `sessionStorage`.
- **Reset Document Body**: Resets the inner HTML of the document body to an empty string.

### Cleanup After All Tests

The `afterAll` hook is used to clean up after all tests have run:

- **Use Real Timers**: Restores the use of real timers.

### Handle Unhandled Promise Rejections

The `process.on('unhandledRejection')` event handler is used to handle unhandled promise rejections:

- **Log Error**: Logs the error and the promise that caused the unhandled rejection.
- **Fail the Test**: Throws the reason for the unhandled rejection to fail the test.
