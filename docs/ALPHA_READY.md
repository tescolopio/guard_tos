## 🎯 Your Next Steps (Right Now!)

### Step 1: Load Extension (5 minutes)

```bash
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Go to: chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle top-right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Navigate to: /mnt/d/guard_tos/dist
6. Click "Select Folder"
```

**Expected Result:** Terms Guardian appears in extensions list, icon in toolbar ✨

### Step 2: Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

1. **Click extension icon** → Side panel should open
2. **Visit Google ToS:** https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
3. **Extension should detect** → Offer to analyze
4. **Click "Analyze"** → See results in < 5 seconds

**Expected Result:** Analysis completes, results displayed, no errors ✅

### Step 3: Run Test Suite (15 minutes)

Open **docs/ALPHA_TEST_LOG_TEMPLATE.md** and test all 10 sites:
1. Google Terms
2. Facebook Terms
3. Twitter/X Terms
4. Amazon Conditions
5. Microsoft Agreement
6. GitHub Terms
7. Spotify Agreement
8. Netflix Terms
9. PayPal Agreement
10. LinkedIn Agreement

Document results for each site ✍️

### Step 4: Check Performance (5 minutes)

- **Chrome Task Manager:** `Shift+Esc`
  - Check memory usage (target: < 150MB)
- **DevTools Console:** `F12`
  - Look for errors or warnings
- **Service Worker:** `chrome://extensions/` → "service worker" link
  - Check background errors

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Must Test Before Moving Forward

- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Side panel opens when icon clicked
- [ ] ToS detection works on at least 5 sites
- [ ] Analysis completes successfully on 8/10 test sites
- [ ] Results display correctly
- [ ] No crashes or freezes
- [ ] Model predictions seem reasonable
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 5s analysis, < 200MB memory)

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Fast analysis (< 3s)
- [ ] Accurate clause detection (> 70%)
- [ ] Helpful summaries
- [ ] Good UI/UX experience
- [ ] Works on edge cases

## 🚦 Decision Matrix

### 🟢 GREEN LIGHT → Proceed to Closed Alpha (Week 2)
- All "Must Test" items passing
- < 3 critical bugs
- Performance within targets
- **Action:** Recruit 3-5 alpha testers, distribute extension

### 🟡 YELLOW LIGHT → Fix & Retest
- Some "Must Test" items failing
- 3-5 critical bugs
- Performance concerns
- **Action:** Prioritize fixes, retest in 2-3 days

### 🔴 RED LIGHT → Major Work Needed
- Multiple "Must Test" items failing
- > 5 critical bugs
- Fundamental issues
- **Action:** Deep debugging, possible Phase 2c model refinement

---

## 🐛 If You Find Issues

### Critical Bugs (Stop Testing)
- Extension won't load
- Immediate crashes
- Complete failure on all sites
- **Action:** Create GitHub Issue, debug immediately

### Minor Bugs (Note and Continue)
- UI glitches
- Slow performance
- Occasional errors
- **Action:** Document in test log, continue testing

### Expected Limitations
- Won't work on PDF-based ToS (known limitation)
- Some sites may have detection issues (expected)
- Model may miss some clauses (~22% FN rate expected)
- May have some false positives (~26% FP rate expected)

---

## 📊 What We're Looking For

### Model Performance Validation
- Does v2025.10.13 generalize to real ToS pages?
- Is F1=0.757 validation performance accurate?
- Are false positives/negatives acceptable?
- Which types of clauses work well vs. poorly?

### Extension Functionality
- Does detection work reliably?
- Is analysis fast enough?
- Is UI/UX intuitive?
- Are there any crashes or errors?

### Real-World Viability
- Would users find this valuable?
- Are results trustworthy?
- Is performance acceptable?
- What's missing or broken?

---

## 💡 Tips for Effective Testing

### Do This ✅
- Test methodically (one site at a time)
- Document everything (use test log template)
- Check console for errors/warnings
- Note both successes AND failures
- Take screenshots of interesting findings
- Test edge cases (very long/short ToS)

### Don't Do This ❌
- Rush through tests without documenting
- Ignore console errors
- Skip sites if one fails
- Test only "easy" sites
- Forget to check performance metrics
- Assume issues will fix themselves

---

## 🎓 Learning Goals

This alpha test will answer:
1. **Does it work?** - Basic functionality in real Chrome
2. **Is it fast?** - Performance metrics on real hardware  
3. **Is it accurate?** - Model validation on live ToS pages
4. **Is it useful?** - Value proposition clear to users
5. **What's broken?** - Critical bugs or design flaws

## 📞 Need Help?

### Quick Reference
- **Installation help:** docs/ALPHA_QUICK_START.md
- **Testing roadmap:** docs/ALPHA_TESTING_PLAN.md  
- **Test tracking:** docs/ALPHA_TEST_LOG_TEMPLATE.md
- **Model details:** docs/training_logs/phase2_complete_summary.md

### Troubleshooting
- **Extension won't load:** Check manifest.json syntax, verify files
- **Analysis fails:** Check console, verify model accessible
- **No detection:** Try explicit ToS URLs, use context menu
- **Performance issues:** Check Chrome Task Manager, close other tabs
