# Terms Guardian: Category-Specific ML Models for Rights Assessment

## Vision: Enhanced Rights Analysis Architecture

Transform Terms Guardian from rule-based pattern matching to category-specific machine learning models for more accurate, granular, and trustworthy rights assessment.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Strengths

- ‚úÖ **ML-Ready Infrastructure**: `rightsAssessor.js` already supports ML augmentation via `mlAugmenter` parameter
- ‚úÖ **Fusion Framework**: Combines rule-based and ML predictions with configurable alpha blending
- ‚úÖ **Chunking Pipeline**: Text is already chunked for processing (500-word segments)
- ‚úÖ **Category Structure**: Uses HIGH_RISK, MEDIUM_RISK, POSITIVES classification
- ‚úÖ **Weighted Scoring**: Sophisticated scoring system with document length normalization

### Current Limitations

- ‚ùå **Limited Categories**: Only 4 ML-augmented categories (ARBITRATION, CLASS_ACTION_WAIVER, LIABILITY_LIMITATION, UNILATERAL_CHANGES)
- ‚ùå **Binary Classification**: Simple presence/absence rather than nuanced scoring
- ‚ùå **No Model Implementation**: Placeholder ML integration without actual models
- ‚ùå **Single Model Approach**: No category-specific specialization

## Legal Corpus Training Strategy

### Paradigm Shift: Category-Focused Training

**Traditional Approach**: Train on manually annotated ToS documents  
**Our Approach**: Train on massive legal corpus for category-specific patterns

### Why This Works

Since our models focus on **specific user rights categories** rather than document classification, we can leverage any legal text that contains relevant patterns:

- **Data Collection Model**: Learns from GDPR text, privacy policies, data protection cases, FTC settlements
- **Liability Model**: Trains on contract law, limitation clauses, court decisions, commercial agreements
- **Dispute Resolution Model**: Uses arbitration agreements, class action cases, consumer protection law

### Massive Training Data Sources

#### Government & Regulatory Sources

```bash
# Example data sources (public domain)
- GDPR full text + implementing regulations (~500K words)
- CCPA/CPRA California privacy laws (~200K words)
- FTC privacy enforcement actions (10K+ documents)
- SEC contract filings (millions of contracts)
- Federal Trade Commission privacy cases
- State privacy law databases
```

#### Legal Academic Sources

```bash
# Academic legal databases
- Google Scholar legal database (millions of cases)
- Legal Information Institute Cornell (comprehensive)
- Justia legal documents (free access)
- Privacy policy research datasets (PolicyQA, etc.)
- Law review articles on privacy/contracts
```

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Case Law & Litigation**

```bash
# Court decisions and legal precedents
- Privacy class action settlements
- Arbitration clause challenges
- Data breach litigation documents
- Consumer protection cases
- Terms of service legal challenges
```

### Implementation Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Corpus Collection & Preprocessing

```python
# Legal corpus data pipeline
class LegalCorpusProcessor:
    def collect_sources(self):
        sources = {
            'gdpr': self.download_gdpr_text(),
            'ftc_cases': self.scrape_ftc_database(),
            'case_law': self.access_legal_databases(),
            'contracts': self.process_sec_filings(),
            'academic': self.gather_research_papers()
        }
        return sources

    def preprocess_legal_text(self, text):
        # Remove citations, clean formatting, segment appropriately
        return cleaned_segments
```

#### Phase 2: Weak Supervision Labeling

```python
# Automatic labeling based on legal patterns
class WeakSupervisionLabeler:
    def label_data_collection(self, text):
        patterns = [
            r"collect.*personal.*information",
            r"process.*personal.*data",
            r"obtain.*information.*about.*you",
            r"gather.*data.*from.*users"
        ]
        return self.pattern_match_scoring(text, patterns)
```

#### Phase 3: Transfer Learning

```python
# Pre-train on legal corpus, fine-tune on ToS
class CategorySpecificModel:
    def train_pipeline(self):
        # 1. Pre-train language model on legal corpus
        legal_model = self.pretrain_on_legal_corpus()

        # 2. Fine-tune for specific category
        category_model = self.finetune_for_category(legal_model)

        # 3. Validate on manually annotated ToS
        accuracy = self.validate_on_tos_dataset(category_model)

        return category_model
```

### Advantages of This Approach

1. **üöÄ Massive Scale**: Millions of examples vs hundreds of manual annotations
2. **üí∞ Cost Effective**: Leverage existing public legal data
3. **üéØ Higher Quality**: Models understand legal concepts deeply
4. **‚ö° Faster Development**: Start training immediately with existing corpus
5. **üîÑ Better Generalization**: Handle novel legal language patterns
6. **üìä Robust Validation**: Test across multiple legal document types

## üöÄ Production Readiness Workstreams

To ship category-specific models with confidence, we organize the implementation into six end-to-end workstreams. Each stream has clear deliverables, owners, and success criteria that map directly to the URI grading rubric.

### 1. Audit Current ML Assets

- Inventory the shipping TF-IDF/logistic regression bundle (`dictionaries/tfidf_logreg_v2.json`) and confirm how it is loaded in `rightsAssessor.js`.
- Review `docs/training_progress.md`, `EXT_CONSTANTS.ML` defaults, and existing Jest fixtures to understand baseline behavior.
- Capture open gaps (missing categories, null readability fields) and document known limitations before introducing new models.

### 2. Design Training Data Pipeline

- Finalize corpus sources per category (GDPR/CCPA, FTC settlements, SEC filings, adversarial ToS examples) with licensing notes.
- Implement ingestion + preprocessing scripts (segmentation, citation stripping, normalization) and store them under `scripts/corpus/`.
- Define weak-supervision labelers and gold-standard annotation guidelines with legal SMEs; track datasets via a manifest (size, date, coverage). See `docs/ml/training-data-pipeline.md` for the detailed blueprint and `docs/ml/gold-datasets.md` for gold evaluation dataset requirements.

### 3. Implement Category Models

- Choose lightweight architectures (DistilBERT ‚Üí distilled TF.js or classic models) and codify training scripts with reproducible seeds.
- Run hyperparameter sweeps, calibrate thresholds for precision ‚â•0.80, and constrain model artifacts to <10‚ÄØMB compressed.
- Produce model cards and change logs per release so QA/legal can audit behavior. Reference `docs/ml/category-models.md` for artifact requirements and promotion checklist, and use `scripts/ml/calibrate_category_model.py` plus `scripts/ml/export_category_model.py` as the standard tooling.

### 4. Integrate Models in the Extension

- Extend the async loader in `rightsAssessor.js` to fetch category models lazily with feature flags and graceful fallback.
- Move inference onto Web Workers with chunk batching to keep the UI responsive; ensure rule-only mode stays green.
- Update configuration (`constants.js`) so alpha blending and per-category thresholds are centrally managed.

### 5. Validation & Benchmarking

- Build an evaluation harness that runs precision/recall, confusion matrices, and latency measurements against gold corpora and adversarial fixtures.
- Automate regression comparisons between rule-only and ML-augmented analyses; surface deltas in CI artifacts.
- Establish a promotion checklist (QA sign-off, legal review, reproducible notebooks) before a model ships. See `docs/ml/evaluation-plan.md` for detailed workflow and metrics.

### 6. Ops, Monitoring, and Documentation

- Package model artifacts with integrity hashes, CDN/CD pipeline instructions, and offline fallbacks.
- Update developer docs (`docs/analysis/user-rights-index.md`, `docs/architecture.md`) plus user-facing messaging for new scores.
- Plan for telemetry-free health checks, manual feedback loops, and a re-training cadence documented in `docs/training_progress.md`.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (4-6 weeks)

**Goal**: Implement one category-specific model to validate approach

#### 1.1 Data Privacy Model Implementation

```javascript
// src/ml/models/dataPrivacyClassifier.js
class DataPrivacyClassifier {
  constructor(config = {}) {
    this.model = null;
    this.threshold = config.threshold || 0.6;
    this.categories = [
      "data_collection_extensive",
      "data_collection_minimal",
      "consent_explicit",
      "consent_implied",
      "purpose_specific",
      "purpose_broad",
    ];
  }

  async loadModel() {
    // Load TensorFlow.js model optimized for data privacy clauses
    this.model = await tf.loadLayersModel("/models/data-privacy-v1/model.json");
  }

  async classifyText(text) {
    // Tokenize and predict privacy-related classifications
    const predictions = await this.model.predict(this.tokenize(text));
    return this.formatPredictions(predictions);
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Training Data Collection - Legal Corpus Approach

**üöÄ KEY INSIGHT**: Since we're analyzing text against specific user rights categories, we can train on ANY legal corpus, not just ToS documents!

**Primary Sources - Legal Corpus (Millions of Examples)**:

- **GDPR & Privacy Regulations**: Complete regulatory text, implementation guides, enforcement actions
- **Legal Databases**: Google Scholar legal, Justia, Cornell Legal Information Institute
- **Government Documents**: SEC filings, FTC privacy settlements, regulatory guidance
- **Case Law**: Privacy-related court decisions, arbitration cases, class action settlements
- **Contract Databases**: Public SEC contract filings, standardized contract libraries
- **Academic Legal Literature**: Law review articles, legal research papers

**Secondary Sources - Manual Annotation (Hundreds of Examples)**:

- **High-Quality ToS/Privacy Policies**: Expert-annotated for validation and fine-tuning
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual or problematic clauses for adversarial testing
- **Cross-Domain Validation**: Ensure models work across different legal contexts

**Training Strategy**:

- **Weak Supervision**: Auto-label legal corpus using pattern matching and keywords
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on legal corpus, fine-tune on ToS-specific examples
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Train across related legal categories simultaneously

#### 1.3 Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: DistilBERT (lightweight for browser deployment)
- **Fine-tuning**: Domain-specific legal text training
- **Output**: Multi-label classification with confidence scores
- **Size Target**: <10MB compressed for browser performance

### Phase 2: Multi-Category Expansion (8-10 weeks)

**Goal**: Implement 3-4 core categories with integrated scoring

#### 2.1 Additional Models

- Liability & Legal Protection Classifier
- User Control & Rights Classifier
- Dispute Resolution Classifier

#### 2.2 Enhanced Scoring System

```javascript
// Enhanced rights assessment with category-specific models
async function assessRights(text) {
  const categories = await Promise.all([
    dataPrivacyModel.classify(text),
    liabilityModel.classify(text),
    userControlModel.classify(text),
    disputeModel.classify(text),
  ]);

  return {
    overallScore: calculateWeightedScore(categories),
    categoryScores: {
      dataPrivacy: calculateCategoryScore(categories[0]),
      liability: calculateCategoryScore(categories[1]),
      userControl: calculateCategoryScore(categories[2]),
      dispute: calculateCategoryScore(categories[3]),
    },
    detailedFindings: extractKeyFindings(categories),
    riskFactors: identifyHighRiskAreas(categories),
  };
}
```

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (12-16 weeks)

**Goal**: Complete 8-category system with advanced features

#### 3.1 Complete Model Suite

- All 8 categories implemented
- Ensemble voting for overlapping classifications
- Confidence-based weighting
- Active learning for continuous improvement

#### 3.2 Advanced Features

- **Comparative Analysis**: "This policy vs industry average"

## üí° Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Integration

#### Current Fusion Point Enhancement

```javascript
// Enhanced ML augmentation in rightsAssessor.js
async function augmentWithML(chunk, res, mlConfig) {
  try {
    const models = await loadCategoryModels();
    const predictions = await Promise.all([
      models.dataPrivacy.classify(chunk),
      models.liability.classify(chunk),
      models.userControl.classify(chunk),
      // ... other categories
    ]);

    // Fuse rule-based and ML predictions per category
    const fusedScores = fusePredictions(
      res.clauseCounts,
      predictions,
      mlConfig,
    );

    // Update clause counts with ML-enhanced detections
    updateClauseCounts(res.clauseCounts, fusedScores);

    return {
      categoryScores: calculateCategoryScores(fusedScores),
      confidence: calculateConfidence(predictions),
      explainability: generateExplanations(predictions, chunk),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Graceful fallback to rule-based analysis
    return fallbackAnalysis(chunk, res);
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Model Compression

- **Quantization**: 8-bit model weights for smaller file sizes
- **Pruning**: Remove less important neural network connections
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller models from larger teacher models

#### 2. Lazy Loading

```javascript
// Load models on-demand to reduce initial bundle size
const ModelManager = {
  models: new Map(),

  async getModel(category) {
    if (!this.models.has(category)) {
      const model = await this.loadModel(category);
      this.models.set(category, model);
    }
    return this.models.get(category);
  },
};
```

#### 3. Parallel Processing

- Process multiple categories simultaneously using Web Workers
- Chunk-level parallelization for large documents
- Background model loading during extension initialization
