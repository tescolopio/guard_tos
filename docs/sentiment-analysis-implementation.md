# [ARCHIVED] Sentiment Analysis Implementation (Stub)

This historical concept has been archived and is no longer part of the MVP.

- Preserved copy: `docs/archive/sentiment-analysis-implementation.md`
- Current approach: `docs/analysis/user-rights-index.md` (URI with 8 categories and readability blend)
- See also: `docs/analysis/rightsAssessor.md` for how rules map into the URI

Note: The project moved from free-form “sentiment grading” to a formal User Rights Index rubric. This page remains only as a pointer for historical reference.
