## Metrics & Data Collection

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Analysis Time | < 3s | console.time() |
| Memory Usage | < 100MB | Chrome Task Manager |
| Extension Load Time | < 500ms | Performance API |
| Model Inference Time | < 1s | Profiling |
| Storage Usage | < 5MB | chrome.storage API |

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Clause Detection Accuracy | > 80% | Manual verification |
| False Positive Rate | < 20% | Error analysis |
| False Negative Rate | < 20% | Missed clause review |
| User Satisfaction | > 4/5 | Survey feedback |
| Bug Reports | < 10 critical | Issue tracker |

### Logging Strategy
```javascript
// Performance logging
console.time('analysis-duration');
// ... analysis code ...
console.timeEnd('analysis-duration');

// Error logging
try {
  // ... risky operation ...
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[TermsGuardian] Error:', error);
  // Send to error tracking (optional)
}

// Model prediction logging
console.log('[Model] Prediction:', {
  label: prediction.label,
  confidence: prediction.confidence,
  text: prediction.text.substring(0, 100)
});
```

## Alpha Tester Onboarding

### Installation Instructions

**Option 1: Load Unpacked (Development)**
```bash
1. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the guard_tos directory
5. Extension icon should appear in toolbar
```

**Option 2: Load CRX (Packaged)**
```bash
1. Download terms-guardian-alpha.crx
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Drag and drop the .crx file onto the page
5. Click "Add extension" when prompted
```

### First-Time Setup
1. Click the Terms Guardian icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Side panel opens with welcome message
3. Navigate to any website with Terms of Service
4. Extension automatically detects and offers to analyze
5. Click "Analyze" button to run ML analysis

### Troubleshooting
- **Extension won't load**: Check console for errors, verify manifest.json
- **Analysis fails**: Check if content is actually ToS, verify model is loaded
- **Side panel blank**: Check serviceWorker.js is running, inspect background page
- **No detection**: Navigate to explicit ToS URL, use context menu as fallback
