# [ARCHIVED] Grade-Based Implementation (Stub)

This historical concept has been archived and replaced by the User Rights Index (URI).

- Preserved copy: `docs/archive/grade-based-implementation.md`
- Current spec: `docs/analysis/user-rights-index.md`
- See also: `docs/analysis/rightsAssessor.md`

Note: The project moved from letter-grade concepts to a formal 8-category URI with weights and a readability blend. This page remains only as a pointer for historical reference.
