## 3. User Rights Index (Manual)

| Category | Manual Score (0-100) | Grade | Key Evidence |

| Data Collection & Use | 55 | C- | Privacy handled through separate notice; terms disclose third-party involvement but provide minimal detail within document. |

**Weighted URI Score (Manual):** 38

**Guardrail Notes:** Elevated concern over perpetual content license, unilateral termination, and strong liability disclaimers without meaningful remedy or notice requirements.

## 4. Overall Summary

Amazon’s Conditions of Use concentrate nearly all control with the platform, granting itself sweeping rights over user content, pricing decisions, and remedial pathways. Users agree to far-reaching liability limitations, including broad disclaimers that cap recourse to product returns or limited refunds. Dispute resolution is restricted to Washington state courts with a jury waiver, raising access concerns for global customers. The terms also enable unilateral policy changes and cross-reference multiple external documents, which complicates informed consent. Overall risk is high for content creators and consumers who rely on clear notice and fair venue choice.
