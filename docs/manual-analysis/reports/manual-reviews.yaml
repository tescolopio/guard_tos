    overall_summary: |-
      GitHub's Terms of Service blends approachable summaries with dense legal clauses governing account usage, content licensing, and acceptable behavior. Users keep ownership of their content but must provide GitHub and other users expansive rights, particularly for open collaboration, while moral rights waivers enable service functionality. Private repositories receive confidentiality protections, yet GitHub retains access rights for security, compliance, and support. Liability is tightly limited and disputes must be pursued in California courts, with little recourse for consequential damages. Organizations and developers should pair the terms with internal policies to monitor changes, manage API usage, and document how confidential or proprietary material is handled within GitHub ecosystems.

    overall_summary: |-
      AWS’s learner terms centralize control with AWS, granting it broad rights to capture, reuse, and disseminate participant recordings and materials with minimal opt-out. The agreement leans heavily on other AWS policies, making it difficult for learners to interpret data handling or dispute pathways without cross-referencing multiple documents. Learners bear responsibility for compliance and risk suspension or loss of access if AWS perceives security or commercial misuse. While the document covers international participation and age brackets in detail, it offers limited assurances on privacy, change control, or liability beyond statutory minimums.

    overall_summary: |-
      Amazon’s Conditions of Use concentrate nearly all control with the platform, granting itself sweeping rights over user content, pricing decisions, and remedial pathways. Users agree to far-reaching liability limitations, including broad disclaimers that cap recourse to product returns or limited refunds. Dispute resolution is restricted to Washington state courts with a jury waiver, raising access concerns for global customers. The terms also enable unilateral policy changes and cross-reference multiple external documents, which complicates informed consent. Overall risk is high for content creators and consumers who rely on clear notice and fair venue choice.

    overall_summary: |-
      DuckDuckGo’s Terms of Service strike a privacy-forward tone—emphasizing the company’s non-tracking stance—while still embedding traditional platform protections. Users benefit from concise language and an explicit "We don’t track you" pledge, yet substantive detail on data handling lives in the Privacy Policy rather than the terms themselves. Liability and warranty clauses revert to standard all-caps disclaimers that sharply limit monetary relief, and venue is fixed in New York courts, which may be impractical for users outside the U.S. Overall risk is moderate: privacy commitments are positive, but dispute resolution access and perpetual rights to user feedback warrant continued monitoring.

    overall_summary: |-
      Khan Academy’s Terms of Service blend learner-friendly goals with institutional compliance requirements. While users keep ownership of submissions, Khan Academy secures broad rights to host, analyze, and adapt content—extending to AI-generated output and educational materials. Parents, schools, and coaches face detailed consent and supervision duties, particularly when enabling linked or anonymized student accounts. Dispute options are tightly constrained by mandatory arbitration and class-action waivers, and change-management provisions allow rapid updates. Organizations adopting Khan Academy should inventory linked policies, confirm data-sharing authorizations, and prepare escalation paths that satisfy both education law and arbitration prerequisites.

      score: 30
      grade: "F"

    - name: "Terms Changes"
      score: 40

  critical_concerns:
    - "Perpetual, irrevocable content license with third-party syndication rights, metadata removal, and moral rights waiver"
    - "$100 liability cap (US version) for free users—effectively zero accountability for breaches, negligence, wrongful suspensions"
    - "Unilateral account termination 'at any time for any or no reason' without due process or appeal mechanism"
    - "Unlimited user indemnification obligation (no cap) contrasts with Reddit's $100 liability cap—massive asymmetry"
    - "Data practices entirely delegated to Privacy Policy (99/100 risk); consent deemed given through use"
    - "Content moderation discretion: Reddit may remove/demonetize content 'at any time and for any reason'"
    - "Exclusive California venue (US version) creates access-to-justice barriers; travel costs, local counsel fees"
    - "Surviving obligations: content license, indemnification, use restrictions persist indefinitely after account deletion"
    - "EEA version has 30-day change notice but retains perpetual content license and broad termination rights"

section_summaries:
  - section: "Section 2: Privacy"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Data Privacy"
      - "Informational Self-Determination"
      - "Consent"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Two-sentence section delegates entirely to Privacy Policy (separate 10+ page document)"
      - "'Through your use... you consent to the collection and use of this information'"
      - "Consent-by-use model: no opt-in mechanism"
      - "Automated data practices risk: 99/100"
    notes: "Binding consent to entire Privacy Policy without summary; conflates contractual acceptance with informed consent; EEA version identical despite GDPR requiring explicit consent for sensitive processing"

  - section: "Section 5: Your Content"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Intellectual Property Ownership"
      - "Content Control"
      - "Moral Rights"
      - "Attribution"
      - "Monetization"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to all user content"
      - "License includes right to syndicate to 'other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit'"
      - "Reddit may remove metadata (EXIF data, creator identifiers)"
      - "Users 'irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution'"
      - "Reddit may delete, deem ineligible for monetization, or remove content 'at any time and for any reason'"
      - "No compensation for use of user content"
    notes: "Most aggressive provision—users cannot revoke license even after deleting content/account; third-party syndication enables licensing to AI firms, advertisers, media without consent/payment; metadata removal eliminates authorship proofs; 'deem ineligible for monetization' blocks Creator Program earnings without cause; automated Content/IP risk: 96/100"

  - section: "Section 7: Things You Cannot Do"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Use Restrictions"
      - "Research Access"
      - "Enforcement Discretion"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Incorporates Content Policy by reference (subjective standards)"
      - "Prohibits: interference, unauthorized access, malware, IP infringement, unauthorized scraping, 'fraud on Reddit'"
      - "Scraping 'without Reddit's prior written consent is prohibited' (but crawling per robots.txt conditionally permitted)"
      - "Vague 'abuse of or fraud on Reddit' standard"
    notes: "Scraping prohibition chills academic research, journalism, competitive analysis; 'fraud on Reddit' undefined grants broad enforcement discretion; Content Policy contains subjective standards ('excessive profanity')"

  - section: "Section 8: Moderators"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Volunteer Labor"
      - "Community Governance"
      - "Compensation"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Moderator status 'unofficial, voluntary' with no compensation"
      - "Reddit may revoke privileges 'at any time and for any reason or no reason'"
      - "Moderators may not receive third-party compensation"
      - "Moderators not authorized to represent Reddit"
      - "Reddit may 'overturn any action or decision' of moderators"
    notes: "Extracts free labor while retaining absolute control; prohibition on compensation prevents monetization; 'overturn' right undermines community self-governance; no equity or succession rights despite thousands of hours invested"

  - section: "Section 12: Indemnity"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Financial Liability"
      - "Legal Defense Obligations"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Users defend, indemnify, hold Reddit Entities harmless from third-party claims arising from: use, Terms violations, law violations, Your Content"
      - "Covers 'liability, damage, loss, and expense (including costs and attorneys' fees)'"
      - "No liability cap on user indemnification (contrasts with Reddit's $100 cap)"
      - "Reddit controls defense strategy; users must cooperate"
    notes: "Unlimited financial exposure—posting copyrighted image could create multi-million-dollar liability; 'arising from use' could include unrelated claims; asymmetry with Section 13 liability cap; survives account termination; may be unenforceable for consumers but US version has no exception"

  - section: "Section 13: Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability (US)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Legal Remedies"
      - "Damages Recovery"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Services 'AS IS' and 'AS AVAILABLE' without warranties"
      - "No implied warranties of merchantability, fitness, non-infringement"
      - "No liability for indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, punitive damages"
      - "Aggregate liability capped at greater of $100 or six months' fees"
      - "Free users: $100 total cap applies to all claims (breaches, negligence, statutory violations)"
      - "Limitations apply 'even if Reddit Entities advised of possibility of damage'"
    notes: "Most aggressive liability limitation reviewed; $100 cap covers data breaches, wrongful removals, defamation, negligence; automated Liability risk 98/100; may be unconscionable but venue clause routes to California; free users have virtually no remedy"

  - section: "Section 13: Limitation of Liability (EEA)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Legal Remedies (narrower than US)"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Liability 'limited to maximum extent permissible in your country'"
      - "Limited to 'foreseeable damages arising from breach of material contractual obligations'"
      - "Excludes: statutory liability, death/injury from negligence, specific promises"
      - "No explicit monetary cap"
    notes: "Narrower disclaimers comply with EEA consumer protection laws; 'foreseeable damages' aligns with civil law; 'material obligations' undefined; statutory liability preservation critical for GDPR; no explicit cap (likely unenforceable anyway); significant improvement over US version"

  - section: "Section 14: Governing Law and Venue (US)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Access to Justice"
      - "Legal Costs"
    key_takeaways:
      - "California law governs (without conflict of laws rules)"
      - "Exclusive jurisdiction: federal/state courts in San Francisco, California"
      - "Personal jurisdiction consented"
      - "No arbitration clause (unusual—preserves class action rights)"
    notes: "San Francisco venue creates access barriers for non-California users (travel, local counsel); California law may favor Reddit as CA corporation; no arbitration means class actions possible but venue chills suits; U.S. government exception suggests institutional carve-outs"

  - section: "Section 15/14: Changes to these Terms"
    risk_level: "High (US) / Medium (EEA)"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Notice"
      - "Consent to Modifications"
    key_takeaways:
      - "US: Reddit may change terms; material changes (Reddit's 'sole discretion') *may* trigger notice; continued use = acceptance"
      - "EEA: Material changes (Reddit's 'reasonable discretion') trigger 30-day advance notice; email or in-service notice"
      - "Both: must stop using before changes effective to avoid acceptance"
    notes: "US version: no guaranteed notice ('may also notify'); 'material' determined by Reddit; 'continued use' acceptance impractical. EEA: 30-day notice provides meaningful review time. Both allow unilateral modifications; revision history available but no alert system"

  - section: "Section 17/16: Termination"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Account Access"
      - "Content Removal"
      - "Survival of Obligations"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Users terminate by deleting account and discontinuing use"
      - "Prolonged inactivity may trigger involuntary deactivation (duration undefined)"
      - "Reddit may suspend/terminate 'at any time for any or no reason'"
      - "No appeal or reinstatement process"
      - "Surviving: Your Content (5), Prohibitions (7), Indemnity (12), Liability (13), Governing Law (14), Termination (17), Misc (18)"
    notes: "'Any or no reason' permits arbitrary/discriminatory terminations; no due process; account suspension doesn't terminate content license (survives); indemnification survives termination indefinitely; 'prolonged inactivity' undefined; no data export right"

  - section: "Section 18/17: Miscellaneous"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Contract Interpretation"
      - "Assignment"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Agreement + Privacy Policy + incorporated docs = entire agreement"
      - "Non-waiver, severability clauses"
      - "Users cannot assign/transfer without Reddit consent"
      - "Reddit may 'freely assign' rights and obligations"
      - "Interpretation rules: 'include' non-exhaustive, 'or' means 'and/or'"
    notes: "Asymmetric assignment: Reddit can sell user obligations to acquirer without consent/notice; 'entire agreement' prevents reliance on marketing; non-waiver preserves Reddit's enforcement discretion; interpretation rules favor broad restrictions reading"

glossary:
  - term: "Perpetual, Irrevocable, Sublicensable License"
    definition: "When you post content to Reddit, you give Reddit permanent permission to use, modify, and distribute that content anywhere in the world, forever. You can never take this permission back (irrevocable), even if you delete your post or account. Reddit can also give this same permission to other companies (sublicensable) without asking you again."
    reference: "Section 5: Your Content"
    user_impact: "Reddit could license your posts to AI training companies, marketing firms, or competitors—forever—without compensating or notifying you. Exceeds even Facebook's content license, which allows revocation by deletion."
  
  - term: "Indemnify"
    definition: "If someone sues Reddit because of something you posted or did on the platform, you agree to pay Reddit's legal bills and any damages. This includes attorney's fees, court costs, and settlement amounts."
    reference: "Section 12: Indemnity"
    user_impact: "Posting a copyrighted image could make you responsible for defending Reddit in a multi-million-dollar lawsuit, even if you're an individual with no assets. The $100 liability cap protecting Reddit does NOT apply to your indemnification obligations—yours are unlimited and survive account deletion."
  
  - term: "Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability"
    definition: "Reddit promises you virtually nothing about quality, safety, or reliability of its services, and limits its financial responsibility to $100 (or amount paid in last 6 months, whichever is greater). If Reddit's negligence causes harm—data breach, wrongful suspension, defamatory content—you can only recover $100, even if actual damages are millions."
    reference: "Section 13 (US version)"
    user_impact: "For free users, Reddit has essentially zero financial accountability. Even paid users (Reddit Premium) capped at 6 months' fees (~$50-60 maximum). Far below typical damages from data breaches or reputational harm. EEA version has narrower limitations due to consumer protection laws."
  
  - term: "Moral Rights"
    definition: "The legal right to be credited as creator of your work and to object if someone distorts or misuses it in a way that harms your reputation."
    reference: "Section 5: Your Content"
    user_impact: "By agreeing to Reddit's terms, you 'irrevocably waive' these rights. Reddit can remove your username from posts, modify them, or use them in objectionable contexts—you cannot complain. Reddit could use your post in an advertisement without crediting you, or a third-party partner could edit your content without permission. Artists, writers, photographers lose important protections."
  
  - term: "Exclusive Jurisdiction"
    definition: "If you have legal dispute with Reddit, you must file lawsuit in San Francisco, California—no matter where you live. This means hiring California attorneys, traveling for court, navigating California procedures."
    reference: "Section 14: Governing Law and Venue (US version)"
    user_impact: "For users outside California, bringing lawsuit becomes prohibitively expensive, even for valid claims. Small claims case costing $500 locally could cost $5,000+ in travel and attorney's fees in San Francisco. Effectively shields Reddit from accountability. EEA version omits this requirement, allowing home-country litigation."

additional_observations:
  - "Document recency (Feb 2024) vs. aggressiveness: No meaningful influence from post-2020 platform accountability debates; perpetual content license and $100 liability cap more aggressive than many competitors"
  - "Dual-jurisdiction strategy: EEA users receive 30-day change notice, narrower liability waivers, likely home-country litigation—none protect U.S. users; demonstrates Reddit's awareness U.S. law permits more aggressive terms"
  - "No arbitration clause paradox: Absence unusual and superficially user-friendly (preserves class action rights), but California venue + $100 cap make litigation impractical, achieving similar deterrent without arbitration's public scrutiny"
  - "Content creator exploitation: Model depends on volunteer content/moderation ('unofficial, voluntary'); perpetual license enables monetization of user contributions indefinitely (AI licensing, media sales) without revenue sharing; contrast YouTube Partner Program, Medium paywall"
  - "Moderator precarity: At-will volunteers Reddit can terminate 'any time for any or no reason'; prohibited from third-party compensation; invest thousands of hours but have no equity, succession rights, job security; Reddit's 'overturn' right undermines community self-governance"
  - "Incorporation by reference overload: Incorporates 6+ external documents (Privacy Policy, Content Policy, Moderator Code, Premium Agreement, Developer Terms, Contributor Terms) plus service-specific terms; users cannot track changes; conflict rule (Additional Terms control) creates uncertainty"
  - "Algorithmic transparency gap: 'Variety of factors' for personalization provides no meaningful explanation of ranking, recommendations, visibility; Help Center reference suggests controls exist but doesn't document in binding Agreement"
  - "Metadata removal implications: Section 5 permission to remove metadata has serious consequences for photojournalists, artists, researchers; EXIF data (camera, location, timestamp) and creator IDs stripped, making authorship proof or license violation detection impossible when Reddit syndicates to third parties"
  - "'Deem ineligible for monetization' discretion: Unilateral power to block Creator Program earnings 'at any time for any reason' postdates 2023 Contributor Program launch; creates financial precarity for creators relying on platform income; no appeal or criteria defined"
  - "Survival clause imbalance: Content licenses (5), use restrictions (7), indemnification (12), liability waivers (13) survive termination—users bound indefinitely after leaving; Reddit's service obligations terminate immediately; one-sided survival favors indefinite content exploitation"
  - "U.S. federal government carve-out: Section 14 exception for federal entities reveals Reddit negotiated special terms for government users; suggests institutional users have bargaining power individuals lack; raises questions about unpublicized custom agreements for corporate/academic partners"
  - "Historical comparison: 379 uncommon terms and dual-version complexity increased from earlier agreements; 2010-2015 terms ~50% shorter, lacked perpetual license's 'syndication' and 'moral rights waiver' language; 2024 version reflects maturation from community platform to content licensing business"

    rights_impacted:
      - "Service Understanding"
      - "Incorporation by Reference"
      - "Provider Identity"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Defines 'Service' as YouTube platform, products, features; incorporates Community Guidelines and Policy, Safety, Copyright by reference creating external dependency"
      - "Provider is Google LLC (Delaware) with California law governance; Alphabet Inc. affiliation mentioned but not primary contracting party"
      - "'Agreement' includes this Terms plus linked policies users must track (Privacy, Copyright Center, Partner Program, Data Processing)"
    notes: "Conversational opening 'Thank you for using' immediately followed by dense legal incorporation; external policies not reproduced inline creates tracking burden"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Age Verification"
      - "Parental Consent"
      - "Minor Protections"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Minimum age 13 (stricter than Reddit none, Apple none); under-18 must 'represent' parental permission but no verification mechanism"
      - "Parents 'subject to terms and responsible for your child's activity' creates liability if minor uploads infringing content or violates Community Guidelines"
      - "Family Link and YouTube Kids referenced but not required; separate terms apply to Kids service"
    notes: "Parental liability open-ended; no age verification means enforcement reactive (suspend after violation) not proactive"

    risk_level: "Very High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Service Access Conditions"
      - "Use Restrictions"
      - "Commercial Activity Limits"
    key_takeaways:
      - "License granted for 'personal non-commercial use' only; 10 numbered prohibited uses including scraping (except robots.txt/permission), metric manipulation, public performances, advertising sales"
      - "'May not' language softer than 'must not' but violations enable termination; reservation clause 'does not give you ownership' reinforces"
      - "Embeddable player explicitly allowed; YouTube controls which features available in your region"
    notes: "Non-commercial restriction conflicts with Creator economy (Partner Program, channel monetization); advertisers/brands may violate if using Service for business without separate agreement"

    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Content Liability"
      - "Automated Scanning"
      - "IP Compliance"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'Legally responsible for Content you submit' places liability on users; 'must not include third-party IP unless permission' shifts infringement risk"
      - "Automated systems 'analyze your Content' for spam, malware, illegal content without explicit consent mechanism; no upload filtering before publication (contrast EU Article 17)"
      - "Community Guidelines enforcement reactive not proactive; users discover violations after publication via strikes/takedowns"
    notes: "Automated content analysis lacks transparency—what data extracted, retention period, secondary uses (AI training?) undisclosed; consent implied by upload not explicit opt-in"

  - section: "License to YouTube (Rights You Grant)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Content Licensing"
      - "Creator Rights"
      - "Perpetual Exploitation"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license 'including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform'"
      - "'In connection with Service and YouTube's business' plus 'promoting and redistributing part or all of Service' enables syndication to third parties"
      - "Perpetual despite 'remove content anytime' language—'licenses continue for commercially reasonable period' after deletion with undefined duration (days? decades?)"
    notes: "'Commercially reasonable period' ambiguity critical—YouTube could license deleted viral video to advertisers/AI trainers/media outlets indefinitely; 'successors and Affiliates' extends to Alphabet companies (Google Search, DeepMind, etc.)"

  - section: "License to Other Users"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "User-to-User Licensing"
      - "Viral Distribution"
      - "Embed Rights"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Other users get worldwide license to 'access your Content through Service' and 'reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, perform'"
      - "'Only as enabled by feature of Service' limits scope; 'does not grant rights independent of Service' prevents downloading for external use"
      - "Embed feature explicitly authorized; viral sharing inherent in platform design (shares, playlists, reactions)"
    notes: "Derivative works permission means reaction videos, remixes, compilations created without original creator approval; fair use may apply but license grants permission beyond fair use scope"

  - section: "Monetization Rights (Right to Monetize)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Monetization Control"
      - "Creator Compensation"
      - "Revenue Sharing"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content' unilateral without opt-in; 'may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users fee'"
      - "'Does not entitle you to any payments' under this Agreement; separate Partner Program required for revenue sharing"
      - "Nov 18, 2020 update: Partner Program payments 'treated as royalties' with tax withholding; creates asymmetry where YouTube profits universally but creators compensated selectively"
    notes: "Contrasts Reddit's perpetual license without ANY revenue sharing vs TikTok Creator Fund, Twitch subscriptions, Medium Partner—YouTube reserves monetization right but gate-keeps creator access via Partner Program (1K subs + 4K watch hours)"

  - section: "Content Removal by YouTube"
    risk_level: "Very High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Content Removal"
      - "Due Process"
      - "Appeal Rights"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'Reserve the right to remove or take down' content if breaches terms or causes harm; 'in our discretion' fully subjective"
      - "'Will notify you with reason' unless legal/investigation/integrity/harm exceptions allow silent removal; no pre-removal notice, no automatic appeal"
      - "Separate Troubleshooting Help Center provides appeal process not documented in Terms themselves; Community Guidelines Strikes system for violations"
    notes: "Four exceptions to notification (legal requirement, investigation, system integrity, substantial harm) create broad carve-out; users may discover removal only when checking channel, already affecting view counts/subscriber trust"

  - section: "Community Guidelines Strikes"
    risk_level: "Very High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Account Integrity"
      - "Due Process"
      - "Strike System"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'System of strikes' for Community Guidelines violations with 'varying restrictions' per strike; 3 strikes 'may result in permanent removal of your channel'"
      - "Appeal process exists via studio.youtube.com but approval discretionary; circumventing restrictions using another channel is 'material breach' allowing Google Account termination not just YouTube"
      - "Repeat infringer termination for copyright under DMCA 512(i); strike duration/expiration not specified in Terms—external Help Center"
    notes: "Circumvention prohibition creates precarity—if Channel A gets strike limiting monetization, creating Channel B to continue posting violates terms with escalation to entire Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Android); single strike can cascade to livelihood loss for full-time creators"

  - section: "Account Termination (Account Suspension & Termination)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:

      - "Access Rights"

      - "'Reserves the right to suspend or terminate' for (a) material/repeated breach, (b) legal requirement/court order, (c) conduct creating liability/harm to users/third parties/YouTube/Affiliates"
      - "'Will notify you with reason' unless legal/investigation/security/harm exceptions; appeal form available but discretionary review"
      - "'May continue using certain aspects like viewing' preserves passive access but loses creative/social features (upload, comment, like, subscribe)"
    notes: "Termination for 'creating harm or liability' to 'Affiliates' extends to Alphabet ecosystem—uploading content causing DeepMind or Google Search harm could terminate YouTube; viewing-only mode inadequate for creators whose income depends on channel; appeal process discretionary not guaranteed"

  - section: "Software License (About Software in our Service)"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Software Access"
      - "Reverse Engineering"
      - "Open Source"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Downloadable software (YouTube Studio, mobile apps) governed by terms; 'personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive' license"
      - "'Not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease' software; 'reverse-engineer or extract source code' prohibited 'unless laws prohibit these restrictions'"
      - "Open source components may override via separate licenses; carve-out for jurisdictions requiring interoperability (EU Software Directive)"
    notes: "Reverse engineering prohibition conflicts with security research, accessibility improvements, interoperability; 'unless laws prohibit' preserves EU/other mandatory exceptions but default is restrictive"

  - section: "Warranty Disclaimers & Liability (Other Legal Terms)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Liability Protection"
      - "Service Guarantees"
      - "Damage Caps"
    key_takeaways:
      - "ALL CAPS 'AS IS' disclaimer: 'does not make any specific commitments or warranties' about Content/features/accuracy/reliability/availability"
      - "7-item exclusion of consequential damages: profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, anticipated savings, data loss, indirect/punitive damages"
      - "Liability capped at greater of (a) revenue paid to you in 12 months or (b) $500; applies 'regardless of whether claim based on warranty, contract, tort'"
    notes: "$500 floor 5x higher than Reddit's $100 but still inadequate—data breach affecting millions capped at $500 per user unless Partner revenue, wrongful channel termination destroying $100K/year livelihood capped at prior 12-month earnings not future loss; consequential damage exclusion means lost business opportunities, reputational harm, emotional distress uncollectible"

  - section: "Indemnification (Indemnity)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Financial Liability"
      - "Legal Defense"
      - "Third-Party Claims"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'Defend, indemnify, and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents' from 'any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debt, expenses including attorney's fees'"
      - "Covers (i) use of Service, (ii) violation of terms, (iii) third-party right violation (copyright/property/privacy), (iv) Content causing third-party damage"
      - "'Defense and indemnification obligation will survive' termination; asymmetric with YouTube's $500 liability cap—user pays unlimited defense costs vs YouTube capped"
    notes: "If third party sues YouTube claiming your video infringed their copyright, you hire lawyers to defend YouTube and pay any settlement/judgment—no cap; obligation survives account closure so you could be defending terminated account years later; parents liable for minors' indemnification under Section 2 parental responsibility clause"

  - section: "Governing Law & Venue (About This Agreement)"
    risk_level: "Very High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Forum Selection"
      - "Legal Access"
      - "Claim Deadlines"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'Governed by California law except conflict of laws rules'; 'litigated exclusively in federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California'"
      - "'You and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction' in Santa Clara; 1-year statute of limitations 'cause of action must commence within one (1) year after cause of action accrues otherwise permanently barred'"
      - "No class-action waiver specified but California venue chills class formation; no arbitration clause unlike most platforms"
    notes: "California venue burden for international/non-California users—small $5K claim could cost $10-20K in legal fees and travel; 1-year deadline may expire before discovering harm (data breaches often have 6-18 month disclosure delays, algorithmic demonetization effects compound gradually); no arbitration preserves class action rights but $500 cap makes class actions impractical anyway"

glossary:
  - term: "Derivative Works"
    definition: "'Prepare derivative works' in license (Section 5) grants YouTube right to modify, remix, create new works from your Content without permission. Could see your video edited into compilation, advertisement, AI training dataset without approval or compensation."
    reference: "Section 5: License to YouTube"
    user_impact: "Critical because 'right to monetize' (Section 9) + 'derivative works' = YouTube can transform your content for profit indefinitely. Viral video could become Google ad campaign, DeepMind training data, or third-party syndication without creator control."

  - term: "Commercially Reasonable Period"
    definition: "'Licenses...continue for commercially reasonable period of time after you remove' (Section 8) creates ambiguity—YouTube retains copy/use rights post-deletion but duration undefined. Could be days, months, years, or decades depending on commercial value."
    reference: "Section 8: Duration of License"
    user_impact: "Particularly concerning for viral content generating ongoing revenue. You delete video but YouTube continues licensing to advertisers/partners for 'commercially reasonable' period determined solely by YouTube's business interests, not your preferences. Contrast platforms with fixed post-deletion periods (24-72 hours)."

  - term: "Community Guidelines Strikes"
    definition: "3-strike system for policy violations with escalating restrictions. Each strike may limit monetization, uploads, features. Permanent channel removal at 3 strikes. Appeal process exists but circumventing restrictions via alternate channel is 'material breach' allowing Google Account termination not just YouTube."
    reference: "Section 11: Community Guidelines Strikes"
    user_impact: "Creates precarity where single strike has cascading effects on creator livelihood. Strike durations not specified in Terms (external Help Center). Circumvention prohibition means if Channel A gets strike, creating Channel B violates terms with escalation to entire Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Android)."

  - term: "Indemnify"
    definition: "User obligation to defend and hold harmless YouTube from third-party claims, including paying attorney's fees. If someone sues YouTube claiming your video infringed their copyright, you must hire lawyers to defend YouTube and pay any settlement/judgment."
    reference: "Section 18: Indemnity"
    user_impact: "Asymmetric because YouTube's liability capped at $500 (Section 17) while your indemnification unlimited. Obligation survives account termination so you could be defending closed account years later. Parents liable for minors' indemnification under Section 2 parental responsibility. No insurance requirement but could face six-figure defense costs."

  - term: "Statute of Limitations"
    definition: "1-year deadline to file lawsuit after 'cause of action accrues' (Section 20). If YouTube wrongfully terminates your account or breaches contract, you have 1 year from incident date to sue or claim 'permanently barred.'"
    reference: "Section 20: Governing Law, Limitation on Legal Action"
    user_impact: "Particularly harsh because harm may not be immediately apparent. Data breaches often have 6-18 month disclosure delays. Algorithmic demonetization effects compound over time. Automated Content ID claims can go undiscovered for years. Copyright strikes may affect employment prospects discovered later. Forces hasty litigation without full damage assessment."

additional_observations:
  - "Automated vs Manual Scoring Discrepancy: Automated tool scored YouTube 87/B (good user protection), manual analysis scored 45/F (very poor)—42-point gap largest among reviews. Suggests automated tool overweights conversational tone ('Thank you for using'), structured formatting (summary index, numbered lists), underweights substantive power imbalances (perpetual licenses, unilateral monetization, $500 cap, 1-year deadline, unlimited indemnification, California venue)"
  - "Perpetual Content Exploitation: Post-deletion license 'commercially reasonable period' ambiguity + 'right to monetize' (Section 9) = indefinite revenue extraction. YouTube could license your deleted video to AI training, advertisers, media outlets years later while you receive nothing unless enrolled in Partner Program separately"
  - "Unilateral Monetization Without Entitlement: Grants YouTube 'right to monetize your Content' (ads/fees) but 'does not entitle you to any payments' under this Agreement. Separate Partner Program required for revenue sharing. Creates asymmetry where platform profits universally but creators compensated selectively. Contrast Reddit (no revenue sharing), TikTok Creator Fund, Twitch subscriptions, Medium Partner"
  - "$500 Liability Floor Implications: Greater of (a) 12-month revenue paid or (b) $500 cap inadequate for serious harms. Data breach affecting millions capped at $500 per user unless Partner revenue. Wrongful channel termination destroying $100K/year livelihood capped at prior 12-month earnings not future loss. Compare Reddit $100 for free users—platforms racing to bottom"
  - "1-Year Claim Deadline vs Delayed Harm Discovery: Statute of limitations 'must commence within one (1) year after cause of action accrues' may expire before users discover harm. Data breaches have typical 6-18 month disclosure delays. Algorithmic demonetization effects compound gradually. Automated Content ID claims can go years undetected. Copyright strikes may affect employment prospects discovered later. Forces premature litigation without complete damage assessment"
  - "California Venue Burden: Santa Clara County exclusive jurisdiction requires non-California users hire California attorneys, travel for depositions/hearings, navigate California procedures. Small $5K claim could cost $10-20K in legal fees and travel. Effectively shields YouTube from most individual suits. International users face currency exchange, visa requirements, time zones. No forum non conveniens relief specified"
  - "No Arbitration Clause Paradox: Absence unusual for major platform and superficially user-friendly—preserves class action rights, right to jury trial, public court proceedings. But California exclusive venue creates similar litigation deterrent without arbitration's public scrutiny. $500 cap makes class actions impractical anyway. Combined venue+cap effectively achieves arbitration's goal (limiting liability exposure) through different mechanism"
  - "Revenue Asymmetry vs Other Platforms: Unilateral monetization 'right' without creator entitlement contrasts models—Reddit Community Points/Contributor Program share ad revenue with karma holders, TikTok Creator Fund pays based on views, Twitch subscriptions/bits 50-70% creator share, Instagram Reels Bonus Program pays verified creators, Patreon/Substack/Medium Partner enable direct creator monetization. YouTube reserves right to profit from ALL content but compensates selectively via Partner Program (1K subs + 4K watch hours gate-keeping)"
  - "Strike System Circumvention Trap: Community Guidelines Strikes section prohibits using 'another channel to circumvent these restrictions' with consequence 'material breach...Google reserves right to terminate your Google account' (not just YouTube). If Channel A gets strike limiting uploads/monetization, creating Channel B violates terms. Punishment escalates from YouTube-specific to entire Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Android). No statute of limitations on circumvention detection—old alternate channels remain indefinite liability"
  - "Parental Liability for Minors Under 18: Users under 18 'represent that you have your parent or guardian's permission' (Section 2). Parents 'by allowing your child to use Service, you are subject to terms and responsible for your child's activity.' If 16-year-old uploads copyright infringing video, parent liable for indemnification defending YouTube from third-party claims including attorney's fees. Parent's Google account at risk if child circumvents strike via alternate channel. Parent's financial assets attachable for judgment/settlement. No parental control features in Terms themselves—only external Family Link references"
  - "Incorporation by Reference Complexity: Agreement includes 'YouTube Community Guidelines and Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies which may be updated from time to time', 'Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising', 'YouTube Data Processing Terms except personal/household activities', 'YouTube Kids Privacy Notice', 'YouTube Partner Program' for monetization, 'Paid Memberships and Purchases' if applicable. Users must monitor 6+ separate policy documents for changes. 'Updated from time to time' creates moving target. Conflict rule not specified if contradictions arise"
  - "Automated Content Analysis Consent Gap: Section 4 'we may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.' No explicit consent mechanism, no opt-out, no transparency about what analysis occurs, how data is used, who has access, retention period. Potential for analysis results used in ways beyond stated purpose (training AI models, providing to third parties, law enforcement without warrant). GDPR's automated decision-making protections (Article 22) may not apply if framed as 'necessary for performance of contract'"
  - "Comparative Context to Prior Reviews: Apple 2009: 30/F, Reddit 2024: 35/F, YouTube 2023: 45/F progression suggests newer/updated terms slightly improve user protections but all remain Very Poor grade (F). Common threads: perpetual/indefinite content licenses, low liability caps ($100-$500), unlimited user indemnification asymmetry, California venue burden, short 1-year claim deadlines, unilateral termination rights, incorporation by reference to external policies, no arbitration but venue barriers equivalent. Improvements marginal: Reddit 30-day EEA change notice, YouTube $500 cap 5x higher than Reddit/Apple $100, YouTube no moral rights waiver vs Reddit irrevocable waiver. Core power imbalances persist across platforms and time periods"

section_summaries:
  - section: "Introduction & Definitions"
    risk_level: "Low"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Service Understanding"
      - "Scope of Agreement"
      - "Nonprofit Mission"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Defines Projects as Wikipedia, Commons, Wiktionary, etc.; Foundation hosts but does not own content"
      - "Community has primary role in creating and enforcing policies—distinguishes from commercial platforms"
      - "Nonprofit 501(c)(3) mission: 'empowering and engaging people to develop educational content under free licenses'"
      - "Incorporation by reference: users must track per-project community guidelines separately"
    notes: "Conversational tone ('Thank You!') contrasts commercial platforms' transactional language. Foundation explicitly positions as hosting service not content owner."

  - section: "Our Services"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Service Nature & Limitations"
      - "Content Responsibility"
      - "No Warranty Basis"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'You are solely responsible for your own use' shifts liability to users"
      - "Content provided by volunteers, Foundation cannot monitor all contributions"
      - "No guarantee of accuracy: 'some information may be false, inaccurate, or misleading'"
      - "Volunteers not agents/employees of Foundation—community contributions independent"
    notes: "Hosting-only model creates different risk profile than publisher platforms. Lack of editorial control reflects Wikipedia's collaborative nature but limits Foundation accountability."

  - section: "Privacy Policy"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Data Protection Reference"
      - "Privacy Policy Compliance"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Privacy Policy separate document incorporated by reference"
      - "Privacy practices may differ by Project—no universal standard across Wikipedia/Commons/Wikidata"
      - "IP addresses of logged-out editors publicly visible in page histories—transparency mechanism but privacy tradeoff"
      - "Registered users' IP addresses visible to admins with CheckUser permission"
    notes: "Privacy analysis beyond scope but separation reflects complexity. Public IP logging common for vandalism prevention but creates privacy vulnerability."

  - section: "Content You Post / Refraining From Certain Activities"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "User Responsibilities"
      - "Prohibited Activities"
      - "Account Termination Basis"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Users 'legally responsible for all your contributions, edits and reuse'"
      - "22 enumerated prohibited activities including harassment, false information, spam, viruses, circumventing restrictions"
      - "Paid contributions must disclose 'employer, client, intended beneficiary and affiliation'—failure triggers Marketing Company Mediation"
      - "Security testing allowed only if: no disruption, not for gain, report vulnerabilities, no malicious intent"
    notes: "Most restrictive section. 22 prohibitions far exceeds Apple's 9, reflecting wiki-specific vulnerabilities (vandalism, edit wars). Paid editing disclosure unique among reviewed documents."

  - section: "Password Security"
    risk_level: "Low"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Account Security Responsibility"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Users responsible for safeguarding password and security credentials"
      - "Should never disclose to third party"
      - "Account compromises due to password sharing user's fault"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Trademark Use Restrictions"
      - "Brand Protection"

      - "All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to Foundation—includes Wikipedia wordmark, puzzle globe logo"
      - "Use must comply with Trademark Policy (separate document)"
      - "'We ask that you please respect our trademarks' softer than commercial platform language"
      - "Protects users from fraudulent impersonators—brand confusion could mislead contributors"
    notes: "Gentler tone than Apple's trademark aggressiveness. Foundation genuinely concerned about scam sites mimicking Wikipedia for phishing."

  - section: "Licensing of Content"
    risk_level: "Very High (but POSITIVE for users)"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Content Licensing Terms"
      - "User Retains Rights (Critical Difference)"
      - "Attribution Requirements"
      - "Creative Commons Framework"
    key_takeaways:
      - "CC BY-SA 4.0 + GFDL dual licensing—users grant broad permissions to general public BUT Foundation does not claim exclusive/perpetual ownership"
      - "Commercial uses allowed 'as long as such uses are compliant with terms'—anyone can sell Wikipedia content if they follow CC"
      - "Attribution required via: hyperlink/URL to article with contributor history, alternative stable copy, or list of all authors"
      - "'No revocation of license': perpetual BUT for community benefit not Foundation profit"
      - "Modifications to reused content must also be CC BY-SA 4.0—copyleft preservation"
    notes: "MOST IMPORTANT SECTION distinguishing Wikimedia from commercial platforms. Reddit/YouTube claim perpetual licenses to monetize; Wikimedia requires licensing TO THE PUBLIC under copyleft terms—Foundation cannot extract revenue."

  - section: "DMCA Compliance"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Copyright Enforcement"
      - "Safe Harbor Protections"
      - "Counter-Notification Rights"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Foundation responds to DMCA-compliant takedown notices to maintain safe harbor under 17 U.S.C. § 512"
      - "'Strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid'"
      - "Community-first approach: 'request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than DMCA process'"
      - "Can post copyright concerns on project-specific Copyright Problems pages"
      - "References Lumen Database for improper DMCA education"
    notes: "More user-protective than typical DMCA policies. Foundation actively encourages counter-notifications. Community-first resolution innovative—volunteer copyright reviewers often identify fair use/public domain cases faster."

  - section: "Third-party Websites and Resources"
    risk_level: "Low"
    rights_impacted:
      - "External Link Liability"
      - "Third-Party Content Disclaimer"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources'"
      - "Foundation does not endorse linked external sites"
      - "Not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, content, products, services, viruses"
      - "No obligation to monitor third-party content"
    notes: "Boilerplate provision. Necessary given Wikipedia articles contain thousands of external citations. Liability shield for malicious sites linked in articles."

      - "Community Governance Model"
      - "Foundation Intervention Authority"

      - "Appeal Rights"
    key_takeaways:

      - "Foundation reserves right to: investigate use, detect fraud, refuse/disable contributions, ban users for repeat violations, take legal action"
      - "Banned users 'prohibited from creating or using another account...unless we provide explicit permission'—sockpuppet prohibition"
      - "Community arbitration committees have 'final decisions' that are 'binding' with sanctions per project policy"
      - "Global Ban Policy allows multi-project bans for especially problematic users"
      - "Appeals process available but discretionary"
    notes: "Highest-risk section. Community governance empowering but Foundation rarely overturns bans even if unjust. Arbitration committees function as private courts with no judicial review."

  - section: "Resolutions and Project Policies"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Board Resolution Compliance"
      - "Project-Specific Policies"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time"
      - "Some policies 'may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition'"
      - "Users 'agree to abide by them as applicable'"
      - "Board resolutions can override community policies in rare cases"
    notes: "Board retains ultimate authority despite community governance emphasis. Users must monitor Board actions—another document to track."

  - section: "API Terms"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted:
      - "API Usage Conditions"
      - "Bot/Tool Operation"

      - "Foundation provides APIs 'to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge'"
      - "Users agree to: User-Agent Policy, Robot Policy, API:Etiquette"
      - "Enables third-party tools: Twinkle (vandalism-fighting), citation generators, mobile apps, research datasets"
    notes: "APIs critical to wiki ecosystem. Policies ensure respectful usage. Lighter touch than commercial API terms—reflects nonprofit mission to enable reuse."

  - section: "Termination"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Voluntary Withdrawal"
      - "Account Blocking Survival"
      - "Public Contribution Persistence"

      - "Users 'can stop using our services any time'—voluntary departure unrestricted"
      - "Blocked accounts: public contributions remain (subject to policies), 'may still access public pages for reading'"
      - "Foundation reserves right to 'suspend or end services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice'"
      - "Survival after termination: Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-16, 18 remain in effect—includes disclaimers, liability limits, licensing, indemnification"
    notes: "Public contribution persistence reflects Wikipedia's archival mission but creates reputational permanence for users—mistakes live permanently with username attached."

  - section: "Disputes and Jurisdiction (HIGHLIGHTED)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Forum Selection"
      - "Governing Law"
      - "Statute of Limitations"
      - "Marketing Company Mediation (Arbitration)"

      - "Marketing Company Mediation for paid editing disputes: Binding Med-Arb where mediator becomes arbitrator, parties split costs, conducted via teleconference or in SF"
      - "Governed by Federal Arbitration Act. Prevailing party recovers attorney's fees"
    notes: "Most concerning section. California venue burden enormous for international community—70%+ editors outside USA. 'Marketing Company Mediation' is arbitration rebranded—loses jury trial, public court for paid editing category."

  - section: "Disclaimers (HIGHLIGHTED)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Service Quality Warranty Waiver"
      - "Information Accuracy Disclaimer"

      - "No responsibility for data loss: 'deletion of, or failure to store or transmit, any content or communication'"

    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted:
      - "Damage Caps"
      - "Consequential Damage Exclusion"
      - "Financial Liability Ceiling"
    key_takeaways:
      - "Yellow highlighted. $1,000 aggregate liability cap: 'In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,000.00) in aggregate'"
      - "Applies to 'any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages'"

      - "'Regardless of whether claim based on warranty, contract, tort'—covers all claim types"
    notes: "$1,000 cap grossly inadequate for data breach affecting millions, wrongful termination of long-time admin, defamation. Nonprofit status does not justify low cap—Wikimedia Endowment $100M+."

      - "Amendment Process"
      - "Community Input Rights"

    rights_impacted:
      - "Miscellaneous Provisions"
      - "Integration Clause"
      - "No Employment Relationship"
    key_takeaways:
      - "'No employment/agency relationship' between users and Foundation—prevents volunteers claiming employment law protections"
      - "'No compensation expectation': 'you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea you provide'"
      - "Free license terms non-modifiable: Foundation and users 'agree not to modify applicable terms and requirements of any free license'"
      - "English version controls over translations: 'original English version takes precedence'"
      - "Severability: partial Terms survive even if courts strike problematic provisions"
    notes: "No employment relationship critical—prevents volunteer editors claiming minimum wage, workers comp. 'No compensation expectation' formalizes thousands of hours editing yields zero payment."

glossary:
  - term: "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)"
    definition: "Free culture license allowing anyone to copy, redistribute, remix, transform content (even commercially) as long as they: (a) give appropriate credit to original authors ('Attribution'), and (b) license any derivatives under identical terms ('ShareAlike'). Most user-protective licensing model among reviewed documents."
    reference: "Section 7 (Licensing of Content)"
    user_impact: "YOU retain copyright and simply grant public permission for reuse. Foundation cannot exclusively monetize—any competitor can copy entire Wikipedia, create commercial product, with only attribution + reciprocal CC licensing obligations. ShareAlike 'copyleft' prevents proprietary capture but means you cannot later commercialize contributions exclusively."

  - term: "GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)"
    definition: "Copyleft license originally for software documentation, now used alongside CC BY-SA for Wikipedia text. Allows copying, redistributing, modifying documents under requirement that derivatives remain free with same license. Wikipedia historically used GFDL exclusively (2001-2009) before adding CC BY-SA option."
    reference: "Section 7 (Licensing of Content)"
    user_impact: "Dual licensing means reusers can choose either license or comply with both—maximizes compatibility. GFDL has more complex requirements than CC BY-SA (full license text, modification history) making it less practical for online reuse, so CC BY-SA dominates. License complexity adds to 497 uncommon terms count."

  - term: "Marketing Company Mediation"
    definition: "Foundation's term for binding 'Med-Arb' combining mediation and arbitration for paid editing disclosure violations. Parties meet for half/full day, mediator facilitates negotiation, any unresolved items decided by mediator acting as arbitrator with legally binding decision. This is arbitration with rebranding."
    reference: "Section 14 (Disputes and Jurisdiction), Section 4 (Paid Contributions Without Disclosure)"
    user_impact: "Mandatory binding arbitration governed by Federal Arbitration Act. If Foundation accuses you of undisclosed paid editing, you lose right to jury trial, public court, class actions. Parties split costs equally (unfair when Foundation has legal staff). Must provide documentation about 'undisclosed paid editing activities including accounts used, articles affected, clients'—self-incrimination compelled. Creates financial barrier to disputing allegations."

  - term: "Community Guidelines / Project Policies"
    definition: "Rules established by volunteer editor communities for specific Wikipedia editions covering conduct, content standards, dispute resolution. Not authored by Foundation—created via community consensus discussions on project talk pages. Policies vary dramatically across projects."
    reference: "Section 10 (Management of Websites), Section 11 (Resolutions and Project Policies)"
    user_impact: "Foundation 'rarely intervenes' in community policy enforcement, meaning volunteer Arbitration Committees have 'final binding decisions' functioning as private courts. Can impose indefinite site bans based on subjective standards with no judicial review. Users contributing to multiple projects must learn separate rule sets. Appeal process discretionary, rarely overturns bans."

  - term: "Indemnification"
    definition: "User obligation to defend, compensate, and hold harmless Wikimedia Foundation from third-party claims arising from user's contributions, including paying Foundation's attorney's fees, settlements, and judgments. Not explicitly labeled in Wikimedia Terms but implied throughout liability disclaimers."
    reference: "Sections 15-16 (Disclaimers & Limitation on Liability), Section 2 ('solely responsible for your own use')"
    user_impact: "If someone sues Foundation claiming your Wikipedia edit defamed them or infringed copyright, you're 'solely responsible'—Foundation disclaims third-party content liability, caps own liability at $1,000, leaving you to bear full cost. Survives account termination. Asymmetric because Foundation protected by $1K cap while your defense obligations unlimited. Volunteer editors subsidize Foundation's legal protection."

additional_observations:
  - "Nonprofit Structure Produces Mixed Results: 65/D score demonstrates organizational incentives matter—removing advertising revenue, perpetual exploitation, monetization clauses yields 20-point improvement over YouTube (45/F). However, 35-point gap to 'good' protection (≥70/C) reveals nonprofit status insufficient—Foundation still deploys liability caps, venue restrictions, indemnification asymmetry, short claim deadlines prioritizing institutional interests."
  - "Transparency Paradox: Wikimedia excels at procedural transparency (30-day comment periods, 100+ translations, yellow highlighting critical sections) but substantive unfairness persists. Highlighting '$1,000 liability cap' makes users aware but does not cure inadequacy. Compare Reddit's dual-version strategy (EEA gets better terms)—Wikimedia treats all users equally but equally poorly on core legal protections."
  - "Creative Commons Licensing as Best Practice: CC BY-SA 4.0 + GFDL dual licensing single most user-protective provision among all reviewed documents. Users retain copyright, grant public permissions, content remains freely reusable by anyone, attribution required, copyleft prevents proprietary capture. Every platform should adopt CC licensing for user-generated content—eliminates exploitation potential while preserving business model."
  - "Community Governance Double-Edged Sword: Foundation 'rarely intervenes' empowers volunteers but also means no institutional accountability for community failures. Volunteer arbitrators impose indefinite bans based on subjective standards, limited appeal process, no judicial review. Editors can invest 15 years, suffer unjust ban, have no Foundation recourse if community sides with admin."
  - "497 Uncommon Terms—Highest Count: Exceeds Reddit (379), YouTube (297), Apple (328) due to Creative Commons complexity, DMCA safe harbor procedures, community governance terminology, 22 prohibited activities. Complexity reflects wiki-specific vulnerabilities and free licensing framework rather than corporate obfuscation, but still creates accessibility barrier for casual contributors."
  - "'Marketing Company Mediation' Rebranding Obscures Arbitration: Paid editing disputes subject to 'binding Med-Arb' where mediator becomes arbitrator—this is mandatory arbitration governed by FAA but terminology avoids negative connotations. Users lose jury trial, public court, class actions. Splitting costs equally unfair. Could weaponize against investigative journalists fact-checking Wikipedia."
  - "International Contributor Access Barrier: San Francisco County exclusive venue particularly harsh given 70%+ editors outside USA. English Wikipedia 100,000+ active editors from 190+ countries. Requiring SF litigation creates access-to-justice crisis—Indonesian contributor wrongfully banned must hire California attorney, international wire transfer, navigate U.S. procedures. Small $5K claim costs $10-20K. Foundation should adopt regional venue options."
  - "1-Year Statute vs. Data Breach Disclosure Delays: 'One year after...could have been discovered with reasonable diligence' may expire before users discover harm. Data breaches 6-18 month disclosure delays typical, wrongful termination effects compound gradually, algorithmic content filtering can go years before user realizes legitimate contributions deleted. Foundation should extend to 3 years minimum aligned with California personal injury statute."
  - "Paid Editing Disclosure vs. Journalism/Academia Complexity: Section 4 requires disclosure of 'employer, client, intended beneficiary, affiliation' for any compensated contribution. Intended to address 'Wikipedia for hire' industry but creates compliance burden for legitimate paid work: investigative journalists fact-checking articles, academic researchers grant-funded, Foundation staff personal edits, nonprofit employees (ACLU, EFF). Should create safe harbor for journalism/academia."
  - "$1,000 Liability Cap vs. $100M+ Foundation Resources: Wikimedia Endowment surpassed $100M in 2021, annual revenue $154M, $90M staff salaries, $40M reserves. Foundation has financial capacity to accept greater liability than $1,000 aggregate cap. Compare YouTube $500 (Google $2T parent), Reddit $100—all shield wealthy institutions from accountability. Nonprofit status does not justify inadequacy—should raise cap to $100,000 per claimant."
  - "Volunteer Labor Exploitation Masked by Mission: 'No compensation expectation' formalizes thousands of hours editing yields zero payment while Foundation raised $154M in 2020-21, paid staff $90M salaries. English Wikipedia ~120,000 active editors contributing ~2.5M hours monthly—volunteer labor sustains $150M+ nonprofit while contributors receive nothing. Should explore revenue-sharing models: micro-payments to top contributors, community grants, Wikipedia Pro subscriptions distributed to editors."
  - "Archival Mission vs. Reputational Permanence: Section 13 public contribution persistence means edits remain in page history forever with username attached even after account deletion/ban. Benefits encyclopedia (prevents content loss) but creates reputational permanence—youthful controversial edits follow indefinitely, mistakes live permanently, pseudonymous identity vulnerable to doxxing. Foundation should implement 'right to erasure' exceptions for: users under 18 at contribution time, content containing personal information disclosed before privacy awareness, contributions created under coercion."

  critical_concerns:
    - concern: "Perpetual Training Exploitation for Free Services Users"
      severity: "Critical"
      description: "Free Services users grant perpetual, irrevocable license to use inputs/outputs to train models after de-identification. De-identification doesn't guarantee anonymity—prompts contain context clues. Zero compensation, no transparency, no expiration."
      
    - concern: "€100 Liability Cap for Free Services (€10,000 for Paid)"
      severity: "Catastrophic"
      description: "€100 (~$108) lowest among all reviewed documents. €10K for Paid Services inadequate given €385M funding. Data breach could cause millions in damages, yet recovery capped at insignificant sums."
      
    - concern: "ICC Arbitration for Non-French Users"
      severity: "Critical"
      description: "ICC filing fees $5K-$10K+ (vs. $200-$400 small claims court). Requires Paris travel, no jury trial, no public record, no appeal. Bars 70%+ international user base from justice. Often exceeds €10K liability cap."
      
    - concern: "Fine-Tuned Model & Agent Ownership Reversal"
      severity: "High"
      description: "Users provide training data to fine-tune models but Mistral AI claims ownership of derivative works. Upon termination, lose access (1-year/30-day retention). Vendor lock-in + value extraction."
      
    - concern: "Zero Data Retention Approval Gatekeeping"
      severity: "High"
      description: "Legitimate reasons undefined, sole discretion approval, no criteria/appeal. Privacy-sensitive users (healthcare, legal, finance) cannot guarantee data protection. Alternative: default zero retention for Paid users."
      
    - concern: "Multi-Document Fragmentation Obscures Rights"
      severity: "High"
      description: "5 separate agreements (207+ sections) fragment rights. No consolidated summary. Data retention varies by service (30 days API, 90 days Chat, 1 year Fine-Tuned, perpetual training). Cognitive overload ensures non-review."

section_summaries:
  - section: "Preamble & Definitions"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted: "Clarity, contractual understanding"
    key_provisions: "60+ defined terms including AI-specific (Fine-Tuning, Weights, Prompts, Outputs, Filters) and GDPR vocabulary (Data Controller, Data Processor, Personal Data). Effective Date = earlier of first use or acceptance (browsing triggers acceptance)."
    critical_language: "User Data means Your Feedback, Input and Output - Mistral AI claims rights to all three categories"
    
  - section: "Purpose, Scope, Acceptance (Sections 2-3)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Contract formation, notice, consent"
    key_provisions: "Acceptance by use. Additional Terms prevail over Terms of Use. Non-substantial modifications: no notice; substantial modifications: 30-day notice."
    critical_language: "By accessing or using any of Our Services, You accept this Agreement"
    takeaway: "Dynamic contract - users can't rely on terms reviewed at signup. Better than Reddit (retroactive) but allows stealth changes via 'non-substantial' classification."
    
  - section: "Accounts & Subscription (Section 4)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Account access, data persistence, deletion rights"
    key_provisions: "Admin Account deletion cascades to all Workspace accounts. Suspension at sole discretion for unauthorized purpose (undefined). No appeal process disclosed."
    critical_language: "Unless otherwise approved by Mistral AI, the deletion of an Admin Account will result in the deletion of the associated Workspace and all related Accounts"
    takeaway: "Nuclear option discourages exit. Team members hostage to Admin Account retention."
    
  - section: "Your User Data (Section 6)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Intellectual property, privacy, training exploitation"
    key_provisions: "Users solely responsible for Output accuracy. Filters can be deactivated (Paid) but users become responsible for offensive outputs. Data usage varies by service (detailed in Additional Terms)."
    critical_language: "We do not warrant that the Output generated will not be offensive, inappropriate or illicit - users bear moderation risk"
    takeaway: "Liability shifted to users for AI errors. Output moderation burden shift contrasts with YouTube's algorithmic disclaimers."
    
  - section: "Fees, Billing, Payment (Section 7)"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted: "Pricing transparency, refund rights, payment disputes"
    key_provisions: "Non-refundable unless stated otherwise. 30-day notice for price increases (can terminate if disagree). Late payment: €40 + 3x legal interest rate per day (Commercial Customers)."
    critical_language: "You authorize Mistral AI to charge Your select payment method every month"
    takeaway: "Non-refundable harsh for quality issues. 3x daily compound interest creates debt spiral for late payments."
    
  - section: "Your Obligations (Section 8)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Usage restrictions, liability exposure, third-party accountability"
    key_provisions: "Broad prohibitions (illicit use, harm to third parties - undefined). No reverse engineering. No DRM circumvention. Third-party liability clause."
    critical_language: "You shall not encourage or assist any other User or third party in doing anything that is strictly prohibited - responsible for others' actions"
    takeaway: "Reverse engineering prohibition prevents security research. 'Harm' undefined - could include criticism. Third-party liability dangerous."
    
  - section: "Intellectual Property & Warranties (Sections 10-11)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Content ownership, derivative works, indemnification obligations"
    key_provisions: "Users retain ownership of User Data BUT Mistral AI retains ownership of Fine-Tuned Models. Services provided as is. Customer indemnifies Mistral AI for User Data claims."
    critical_language: "Mistral AI retains sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the Modified Model, including all intellectual property rights"
    takeaway: "Fine-Tuned Model ownership reversal = value extraction + vendor lock-in. Users contribute training data but don't own results. Liability inversion via customer indemnification."
    
  - section: "Liability (Section 12)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Legal remedies, damages recovery, proportionate accountability"
    key_provisions: "€100 cap for Free Services. €10,000 cap for Paid Services (or 12 months' fees if greater). No liability for indirect/consequential damages. Single recovery exhausts all claims."
    critical_language: "You agree that any Losses or claim You may have can only be recovered once and any such claim will exhaust all and any other claims"
    takeaway: "€100 lowest among all platforms reviewed. €10K inadequate given €385M funding and potential breach damages. Single recovery provision especially harsh."
    
  - section: "Term, Suspension, Termination (Section 13)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Access continuity, exit rights, data portability"
    key_provisions: "7-day notice for suspension (breach/non-payment); immediate suspension for serious breach/security concern (undefined). 30-day cure period. No refunds. Indemnification survives termination."
    critical_language: "Suspension will take effect with shorter notice in event of serious breach or immediate security concern"
    takeaway: "Immediate suspension for undefined triggers. No data retrieval during suspension. Indemnification obligations persist post-termination."
    
  - section: "Personal Data & Privacy Policy (Section 14)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Privacy, GDPR rights, data processing transparency"
    key_provisions: "Dual roles: Data Controller (account/billing) and Data Processor (user data per DPA). Training: Free Services data de-identified and used perpetually; Paid Services excluded (La Plateforme) or opt-out available (Le Chat)."
    critical_language: "We use commercially reasonable efforts to de-identify - no guarantee of anonymization"
    takeaway: "Training on Free Services data = perpetual license with zero compensation. De-identification weak standard. Paid Services protection better but Zero Data Retention gatekept."
    
  - section: "Dispute Resolution (Section 18)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Access to justice, jury trial, public accountability"
    key_provisions: "French users: Paris courts. Non-French users: ICC arbitration at ICC headquarters in Paris (one arbitrator, French law). 60-day executive escalation (Commercial Customers). EU Consumer mediation optional."
    critical_language: "All disputes shall be finally settled under the rules of arbitration of the ICC by one arbitrator...proceedings shall take place exclusively at ICC headquarters in Paris, France - final and binding, no appeal"
    takeaway: "ICC arbitration most expensive among all platforms ($5K-$10K+ fees vs. YouTube's $200-$1.6K AAA). Often exceeds €10K liability cap. Two-tiered justice: French users get courts; non-French get arbitration."
    
  - section: "Additional Terms - La Plateforme"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "API usage, fine-tuning rights, data training"
    key_provisions: "Models API: Free users' data used to train (perpetual); Paid users excluded from training BUT 30-day abuse monitoring (or Zero Data Retention if approved). Fine-Tuning API: Mistral AI owns Fine-Tuned Models. Agent Builder: Mistral AI owns Agents (30-day post-termination retention)."
    critical_language: "You grant Us a worldwide, royalty-free, license to use Your User Data...for the duration of the applicable intellectual property rights (perpetual for training)"
    takeaway: "Perpetual training exploitation for Free users. Zero Data Retention requires discretionary approval. Fine-Tuned Model/Agent ownership reversal extracts customer value."
    
  - section: "Additional Terms - Le Chat"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Conversational data, training opt-out, moderation"
    key_provisions: "Free users: data used to train (perpetual). Paid users: can opt-out via account settings. 90-day retention post-termination (or perpetual if no opt-out). Shared Links allow third-party viewing of conversations. Moderation Policy: harm prevention (children, violence, hate speech) with account suspension."
    critical_language: "The license You grant Us to train or improve Our Models and Our Services is granted for the duration of the applicable intellectual property rights"
    takeaway: "Paid users get automatic training opt-out (better than La Plateforme's Zero Data Retention gatekeeper). Shared Links create privacy risk. Moderation enforcement via account suspension (no appeal disclosed)."
    
  - section: "Partner Hosted Deployment Terms + Appendix 1"
    risk_level: "Medium (High for Specific Access)"
    rights_impacted: "Cloud provider liability, model security, data access"
    key_provisions: "Cloud Provider responsible for infrastructure (availability, security). Mistral AI provides technical support only. Specific Access (closed-weight models): strict security measures, traceability watermarking, unauthorized disclosure triggers IT Expert investigation + indemnification."
    critical_language: "Mistral AI has zero access to Your Cloud Infrastructure...Cloud Provider is solely responsible for the cloud infrastructure"
    takeaway: "Mistral AI disclaims cloud provider liability. Specific Access customers face enhanced security obligations + leak investigation (IT Expert appointed by Mistral AI, customer indemnifies if traced back)."
    
  - section: "Privacy Policy (9 sections)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Data collection transparency, GDPR rights, sub-processors"
    key_provisions: "Collects: identity/contact, payment, inputs (if Personal Data included), outputs, security logs, cookies. Uses: service provision, admin, model training (Free/no-opt-out only), marketing, commercial management, dispute resolution. Retention: 30 days (API abuse), 90 days (Le Chat), 1 year (account post-deletion), perpetual (de-identified training). Sub-processors: 10 listed (Azure Sweden, Google Cloud Ireland/US, Black Forest Labs US, Brave US, Intercom US, Kong US, Lago EEA, Mailjet US, Ory EEA, Stripe US)."
    critical_language: "Your rights have technical limitations and fulfilling Your requests might involve a complex technical process"
    takeaway: "GDPR rights hedged with technical limitations excuse. Sub-processor list includes 6 U.S. companies (surveillance exposure). Perpetual training data retention undermines deletion rights."
    
  - section: "Data Processing Agreement (11 sections + 2 Exhibits)"
    risk_level: "Medium (High for Free Services exclusion)"
    rights_impacted: "GDPR compliance, data controller status, international transfers"
    key_provisions: "Commercial Customers = Data Controllers; Mistral AI = Data Processor for service provision. Exhibit 1 details: data categories, purposes (including training for Free Services), retention, sub-processors. Exhibit 2: technical/organizational security measures. SCCs Module 4 (Processor-to-Controller) for international transfers. Audit rights (annual, commercially reasonable). Personal Data Breach notification (72 hours)."
    critical_language: "When Customer uses the Free Services...de-identifying the Personal Data included by Customer in the User Data for the purpose of training or improving the Models"
    takeaway: "DPA provides transparency exceeding U.S. competitors but Free Services users excluded from Data Controller protections. Training clause buries exploitation in privacy compliance framework. Audit rights discretionary. Liability caps apply to DPA violations."

glossary:
  - term: "Zero Data Retention"
    definition: "Optional feature for Paid Services users where inputs/outputs processed only for generation duration, not retained longer except as required by law. Deactivates 30-day abuse monitoring storage."
    references: "Section 2.2.2.2 Additional Terms - La Plateforme; Section 5 Privacy Policy"
    user_impact: "Privacy protection gatekept by discretionary approval - users must submit request with 'legitimate reasons' (undefined). Mistral AI reviews at sole discretion, may approve or deny. No criteria disclosed, no appeal. Healthcare/legal/finance users bound by confidentiality cannot guarantee data protection. Alternative: default zero retention for all Paid users."
    
  - term: "Fine-Tuned Model (Modified Model)"
    definition: "Any Model fine-tuned, customized, or modified using Fine-Tuning API by adjusting parameters to improve performance, accuracy, or efficiency for specific use cases."
    references: "Section 1 Additional Terms - La Plateforme; Section 2.2.3 Additional Terms - La Plateforme; Appendix 1 Section 6 Deployment Terms"
    user_impact: "IP ownership reversal + vendor lock-in. Users provide proprietary training data but Mistral AI retains sole ownership of derivative works. Upon termination, lose access (1-year retention, then deleted). Contrast with typical SaaS (users own created content). Value extraction: Mistral AI accumulates IP from customer contributions with zero compensation. Customers hesitate to switch due to customization loss."
    
  - term: "ICC Arbitration (International Chamber of Commerce)"
    definition: "Private dispute resolution process conducted under ICC rules by single arbitrator in Paris, France, with final and binding decision (no judicial appeal). Applies to non-French users."
    references: "Section 18.2.2 Terms of Use; Section 14 Deployment Terms"
    user_impact: "Most expensive access-to-justice barrier among all reviewed platforms. Filing fees $5K-$10K+ (vs. U.S. small claims $200-$400, YouTube AAA $200-$1.6K). Requires Paris travel, expert legal representation familiar with French law. Loses jury trial, public record (confidential), appellate review (final/binding), class action (individual only). Often exceeds €10K liability cap - negative expected value for claims. Two-tiered justice: French users get Paris courts (public, appealable, domestic); non-French get ICC arbitration (private, final, international)."
    
  - term: "Data Processing Agreement (DPA)"
    definition: "Separate contract between Mistral AI (Data Processor) and Commercial Customer (Data Controller) governing processing of Personal Data on customer's behalf, ensuring GDPR compliance for EU/EEA users."
    references: "Section 14 Terms of Use; standalone DPA document with 11 sections + 2 Exhibits"
    user_impact: "GDPR compliance theater masking training exploitation. Exhibit 1 provides transparency (data categories, purposes, retention, sub-processors) exceeding U.S. competitors. However: (1) Free Services users excluded - not Commercial Customers so no Data Controller status; (2) Training clause buries exploitation (de-identifying Free data for perpetual training); (3) International transfers to U.S. (Google Cloud US, Black Forest Labs US, Brave US) expose EU users to surveillance despite SCCs. Demonstrates legal compliance coexists with structural exploitation."
    
  - term: "Filters (Output Moderation Mechanisms)"
    definition: "Automatic mechanisms such as moderation prompts implemented by Mistral AI to screen or remove offensive, inappropriate, or illicit content from outputs. Can be deactivated by Paid Services users for legitimate purposes."
    references: "Section 6 Terms of Use; Section 4 Additional Terms - Le Chat (Moderation Policy)"
    user_impact: "Moderation burden shift. Default activated but Paid users can deactivate - upon deactivation, user solely responsible for Output use. Mistral AI disclaims liability while requiring users not harm company/third parties (double bind). Mechanism undisclosed - no transparency on how Filters work, false positive/negative rates, appeal process. Le Chat Moderation Policy details enforcement (child harm = suspension, hate speech/violence = warnings) but lacks independent oversight (cf. Meta Oversight Board)."

additional_observations:
  - title: "Multi-Document Fragmentation = Cognitive Warfare"
    description: "5 separate agreements (Terms of Use, 2x Additional Terms, Deployment Terms, Privacy Policy, DPA) totaling 207+ sections across ~50,000 words. Users must cross-reference to understand rights - e.g., data retention varies by service (30 days API, 90 days Chat, 1 year Fine-Tuned, perpetual training). No consolidated Your Rights summary. 1,195 uncommon terms + -4.68 Flesch + fragmentation = systematic inaccessibility."
    
  - title: "€100 Liability Cap = French Legal Culture Clash"
    description: "€100 cap lowest among all platforms but French law provides stronger consumer protections (Legal Warranty of Compliance, conformity remediation, price reduction, €300K penalty for obstruction). However, liability cap operates in parallel - Consumers can demand conformity but not consequential damages beyond €100. French courts might void as abusive clause but Mistral AI's inclusion of French legal warranty (Exhibit 1) demonstrates awareness - cap targets tort claims, not Consumer Code remedies."
    
  - title: "Free Services Training Exploitation = AI Industry Business Model"
    description: "Perpetual license to train models on Free Services user data reflects industry-wide pattern (OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Meta Llama). Free users = training data donors; Paid users = protected customers. Mistral AI provides more transparency than U.S. competitors but transparency doesn't remedy exploitation: zero compensation, no dataset disclosure, perpetual license, de-identification ≠ anonymization. Estimated value: 100K users × 10 prompts/day × 1 year = 365M training samples worth $10M-$100M."
    
  - title: "ICC Arbitration = French Legal Imperialism"
    description: "ICC arbitration mirrors Wikimedia's California venue burden (70%+ international editors forced to SF). However, ICC more expensive than U.S. litigation: $30K-$115K total (filing + attorney + travel) vs. YouTube AAA $5K-$25K vs. U.S. court $10K-$50K vs. Paris courts €3K-€15K (French users). ICC costs often exceed €10K liability cap - negative expected value prevents claims. Benefits Mistral AI: confidentiality (no public record), no class actions, no precedent (final/binding), French law application."
    
  - title: "GDPR Compliance ≠ User Protection"
    description: "DPA provides transparency exceeding all U.S. platforms (itemizes data categories, purposes, retention, sub-processors, SCCs for international transfers). However, GDPR compliance coexists with exploitation: (1) Training clause (perpetual license disguised as data processing purpose); (2) U.S. surveillance exposure (U.S. API, Black Forest Labs, Brave route EU data to U.S. - CLOUD Act enables warrantless access); (3) Audit rights theater (commercially reasonable = discretionary); (4) Liability caps apply to GDPR violations (€100/€10K vs. Article 83 fines €20M/4% revenue). Lesson: Legal compliance frameworks provide transparency but don't prevent substantive harms."
    
  - title: "Fine-Tuned Model Ownership = AI-Era Sharecropping"
    description: "User provides: training data (trade secrets, customer datasets, domain expertise), compute costs (API fees), labor (data prep, validation). Mistral AI provides: base model, Fine-Tuning API, temporary hosting. Outcome: Mistral AI owns Fine-Tuned Models. Upon termination, user loses access (1-year retention). Contrast with open-source (users own fine-tuned derivatives under Apache 2.0), traditional SaaS (users own created content), cloud providers (customers own trained ML models). Resembles 19th-century sharecropping - value extraction + vendor lock-in. Why? Trade secret protection OR IP portfolio accumulation for industry-specific models."
    
  - title: "Negative Flesch Score = Legal Malpractice"
    description: "Flesch -4.68 extremely rare - occurs when sentences average 50+ words with 4+ syllables per word. Example: Section 11.3 Indemnification sentence = 86 words with 3 semicolon-separated clauses + parenthetical insertions + nominalizations. Requires law degree to parse. Violates French Consumer Code Article L. 211-1 (clear and comprehensible contracts). However, Mistral AI targets B2B market (Commercial Customers might not get Consumer protections). Still, Free Services users are Consumers - deserve accessible terms."
    
  - title: "1,195 Uncommon Terms = HTML Artifacts + Legal Jargon"
    description: "Count inflated by HTML/CSS artifacts (extension 1,052, pwa-extension-ng-components 957, fill 149, border-radius 105, table 176). Filtering technical artifacts, genuine legal complexity ~400-500 terms - comparable to Wikimedia (497). Core jargon: AI-specific (Models, Weights, Fine-Tuning, Prompts, Outputs, Filters, Zero Data Retention), GDPR (Data Controller, Data Processor, Personal Data, SCCs, Sub-processors), contract law (Indemnification, Force Majeure, Severance), French terms (droit de rétractation, CMAP, ICC). Recommendation: provide glossary at document start (not end) with plain-language definitions."
    
  - title: "Tiered Justice System: French Commercial > French Consumer > Non-French Commercial > Non-French Free"
    description: "Four-tier hierarchy: (1) French Commercial - Paris courts + executive escalation, €10K cap, no training, Zero Data Retention; (2) French Consumer Paid - Paris courts + CMAP mediation, €10K cap, no training, opt-out; (3) Non-French Commercial - ICC arbitration + executive escalation, €10K cap, no training, Zero Data Retention; (4) Non-French Free - ICC arbitration, €100 cap, perpetual training, zero privacy controls. Bottom tier experiences: most expensive dispute resolution (ICC exceeds liability cap), lowest protection (€100), perpetual exploitation (no opt-out), zero controls. Mirrors colonial extraction - global Free users subsidize French Commercial Customers."
    
  - title: "Zero Data Retention Approval Criteria = Trade Secret?"
    description: "Legitimate reasons undefined. Possible interpretations: healthcare/legal/financial confidentiality obligations, trade secrets, government/defense classified data, OR arbitrary (customer value, usage, competitive threat). Why gatekeeping? Two theories: (1) Abuse monitoring trade-off (30-day storage enables spam/malware/illegal content detection - zero retention sacrifices safety); (2) Competitive intelligence (prompts provide market research on use cases, industries, feature requests). User impact: cannot guarantee data protection, must trust discretionary approval + implementation, no audit rights to verify. Alternative: default zero retention for all Paid users, opt-in for monitoring."
    
  - title: "Multi-Service Fragmentation = Differential Exploitation"
    description: "User rights vary by service (La Plateforme vs. Le Chat) and tier (Free vs. Paid): Training (La Plateforme Free yes, Paid no; Le Chat Free yes, Paid opt-out); Storage (La Plateforme 30 days or zero retention; Le Chat 90 days); Fine-Tuning (La Plateforme only); Filters (Paid can deactivate); Zero Data Retention (La Plateforme Paid only); Training opt-out (Le Chat Paid only). Confusion: users must track which rights apply where. La Plateforme Paid requires Zero Data Retention request; Le Chat Paid has automatic opt-out. Why different? Product evolution timing. Impact: users might assume La Plateforme Paid has opt-out (seeing Le Chat offers it) but must request separately."
    
  - title: "Mistral AI Score (55/F) vs. Automated Score (76/C) = 21-Point Divergence"
    description: "Automated scored 76/C (62/D rights); manual scored 55/F (21-point gap). Why? Automated favors disclosure over substance - rewards transparency (DPA details, sub-processor lists, retention periods), legal compliance (GDPR, French Consumer Code, SCCs), but misses harms (perpetual training, €100 cap, ICC barriers, Fine-Tuned ownership, Zero Data Retention gatekeeping). Manual adjusts for disclosure ≠ fairness. Mistral AI achieves higher transparency than U.S. competitors but deploys transparency theater - extensive disclosures obscure structural exploitation. 55/F reflects: comprehensive framework undermined by opacity (-4.68 Flesch), discretion (approval gatekeeping), training extraction (perpetual licenses). Positions Mistral AI below YouTube (45/F) - YouTube's $500 + AAA arbitration + perpetual license at least proportionate. Mistral AI's €100 + ICC + training = worst combination."

    overall_summary: |-
      Capture-grounded draft: Quora’s Terms centralize platform control through an expansive multi-tier content license, mandatory individual arbitration (with Mass Filing batching), and narrow opt-out window. The anti-AI training prohibition constrains third-party model development while Quora retains broad redistribution and derivative rights. Liability is capped to amounts paid in the prior 12 months, functionally null for free users, and privacy disputes are compelled into arbitration—foreclosing public accountability. Survival and assignment clauses ensure ongoing exploitation and portability of user content obligations post-termination.

overall_summary: |-
  Initial capture-grounded draft: Quora’s Terms consolidate expansive rights over user-generated knowledge through a broad sublicensable content license coupled with prohibitions against third-party AI model training or automated data extraction. Users face asymmetric obligations—content reuse and derivative creation remain partly irreversible, while Quora can unilaterally modify features and redistribute content across partners and APIs. Arbitration plus class action waiver reduce aggregate redress pathways for U.S./Canadian users. Pending deeper extraction of indemnity and liability clauses, preliminary scoring reflects heavy IP/control asymmetry and limited privacy guarantees inside the operative contract text.

  critical_concerns:
    - concern: "Comprehensive Class Action Waiver for US/Canada Users"
      severity: "Critical"
      description: "IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU ARE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND QUORA WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. Bars collective action for widespread harms (data breaches, systematic discrimination). Individual arbitration uneconomical for small claims ($200-$400 filing + $1K-$5K arbitrator fees)."
      
    - concern: "Jury Trial Waiver"
      severity: "Critical"
      description: "YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND QUORA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Removes Seventh Amendment constitutional protection. Single arbitrator replaces community judgment, no public accountability, extremely limited appeal."
      
    - concern: "Privacy Disputes INCLUDED in Arbitration (No Exception)"
      severity: "Critical"
      description: "For further clarification, disputes relating to your privacy rights are NOT EXCEPTED from this binding arbitration section. Privacy violations (unauthorized data sales, surveillance, CCPA/GDPR violations) must be arbitrated individually. Cannot pursue public interest privacy litigation. Most aggressive arbitration extension encountered."
      
    - concern: "Batch Arbitration for Mass Filings (NAM Mass Filing Rules)"
      severity: "High"
      description: "If 25+ users file similar claims, NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules apply. Staged bellwether arbitrations, mediation opportunity, BUT explicitly NOT class arbitration. Users still proceed individually, no consolidated judgment, no shared attorney. Batch arbitration = procedural management tool (benefits Quora) not collective action substitute."
      
    - concern: "Perpetual License to User Content (Survives Termination)"
      severity: "High"
      description: "Users grant perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license. Cannot revoke even after account deletion. Quora retains monetization rights indefinitely (advertising, training data, derivative products). No moral rights waiver (better than Reddit). Estimated value extraction: 300M+ users × 10 Q&A/year = billions in training data."
      
    - concern: "No Liability Cap Disclosed"
      severity: "Medium"
      description: "Unlike Mistral AI (€100/€10K), YouTube ($500), Reddit ($100), Quora ToS does not explicitly state liability cap in reviewed sections. Likely AS IS disclaimers + consequential damages exclusions present. Without cap, theoretically unlimited exposure BUT arbitration + class waiver + jury waiver limit practical recovery."

section_summaries:
  - section: "Preamble & Acceptance"
    risk_level: "Medium"
    rights_impacted: "Contract formation, consent"
    key_provisions: "By using Quora, you consent to these Terms. Acceptance by continued use (no opt-out). Effective upon first access (browsing = binding acceptance)."
    takeaway: "Standard adhesion contract; users cannot negotiate or reject while using service."
    
  - section: "Content License Grant"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Intellectual property, content ownership, monetization"
    key_provisions: "Perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license. Survives termination. Use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform/display, create derivatives."
    critical_language: "You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license... including the right to sublicense and transfer"
    takeaway: "Identical to YouTube/Apple/Reddit. No moral rights waiver (better than Reddit). Quora can monetize user content indefinitely. 300M+ users × 10 Q&A/year = billions in training data value."
    
  - section: "Indemnification"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Legal liability, financial exposure, third-party claims"
    key_provisions: "Users indemnify, defend, hold harmless Quora from claims arising from use, Terms violations, third-party rights violations, user content. Quora reserves right to assume exclusive defense. Survives termination."
    critical_language: "You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Quora... from and against any and all claims... including reasonable attorneys' fees"
    takeaway: "Liability inversion: user assumes platform's legal risks. User could face attorney fees defending Quora if third party sues over Q&A post."
    
  - section: "Dispute Resolution: Binding Arbitration (US/Canada)"
    risk_level: "CRITICAL"
    rights_impacted: "Access to justice, collective action, jury trial, public accountability"
    key_provisions: "Binding individual arbitration (NAM/AAA). Class action waiver. Jury trial waiver. Privacy disputes INCLUDED (no exception). Batch arbitration for 25+ claims (NAM Mass Filing Rules). Exceptions: IP disputes + Acceptable Use violations. NAM filing $200-$400, arbitrator $1K-$5K+. Discovery limited. Appeal barred. 30-day opt-out period."
    critical_language: "IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE: ... YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. ... disputes relating to your privacy rights are NOT EXCEPTED from this binding arbitration section. ... Quora does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims."
    takeaway: "Most comprehensive arbitration architecture reviewed. Class waiver prevents aggregation of widespread harms. Jury waiver eliminates constitutional protection. Privacy arbitration unprecedented—bars public interest privacy litigation. Batch arbitration provides coordination without consolidation. Cost barrier ($1.2K-$5.4K) exceeds small claims viability. Dispute Resolution category: 25/F (lowest across all platforms)."
    
  - section: "Governing Law & Jurisdiction (Non-US/Canada)"
    risk_level: "High"
    rights_impacted: "Legal venue, applicable law, jurisdiction burden"
    key_provisions: "California law applies. Non-US/Canada users: California courts govern. Requires travel ($2K-$5K+ from international locations)."
    takeaway: "Mirrors Wikimedia California venue burden. Two-tiered system: US/Canada = arbitration; international = California courts. Both tiers create negative expected value for small claims."
    
  - section: "Batch Arbitration (NAM Mass Filing Rules)"
    risk_level: "Critical"
    rights_impacted: "Mass dispute coordination, collective representation"
    key_provisions: "If 25+ similar claims, NAM Mass Filing Rules apply. Staged bellwether arbitrations (10-15 proceed first). Mediation for global resolution. NOT class arbitration: individual claims, separate arbitrators, individual judgments."
    critical_language: "This 'Batch Arbitration' provision shall in no way... authorize class arbitration of any kind"
    takeaway: "Batch arbitration = procedural management tool (benefits Quora) not collective action substitute. Coordination allows shared strategy/discovery but users still pay individually (~$1.2K-$5.4K each). Bellwether results non-binding precedent."

glossary:
  - term: "Binding Arbitration (NAM/AAA)"
    definition: "Private dispute resolution administered by National Arbitration and Mediation or American Arbitration Association, where neutral arbitrator issues final, binding decision enforceable in court."
    references: "Section 11 Dispute Resolution"
    user_impact: "Cost barrier: $200-$400 filing + $1K-$5K arbitrator fees. Discovery limited. No jury. Appeal barred (only manifest disregard of law). Private proceeding (no public record). Comparison: NAM/AAA $200-$1.6K (Quora/YouTube) vs. ICC $5K-$10K (Mistral AI) vs. small claims $30-$200."
    
  - term: "Class Action Waiver"
    definition: "Contractual provision prohibiting users from participating in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration, requiring individual dispute resolution only."
    references: "Section 11, IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE"
    user_impact: "Bars collective action for widespread harms (1M user data breach, systematic discrimination). Individual arbitration costs ($1.2K-$5.4K) exceed small-value claims ($10-$500). Benefits Quora: prevents aggregated liability (1M users × $100 = $100M class action → zero if waiver enforced). US Supreme Court upheld class waivers (AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion 2011)."
    
  - term: "Jury Trial Waiver"
    definition: "Contractual provision waiving Seventh Amendment constitutional right to jury trial in civil cases, requiring arbitration or bench trial instead."
    references: "Section 11, YOU AND QUORA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY"
    user_impact: "Eliminates community judgment (single arbitrator vs. 6-12 jurors). No public accountability. Arbitrators award 50-70% of jury trial damages (studies). Appeals extremely limited. Repeat player effect: arbitrators favor defendants to secure future appointments."
    
  - term: "Perpetual License"
    definition: "Irrevocable, unlimited-duration license granting Quora comprehensive rights to use, modify, distribute, create derivatives from user content, surviving account termination."
    references: "Content licensing section"
    user_impact: "Cannot revoke even after account deletion. Zombie content persists. Quora monetizes Q&A for advertising, training data (AI models), derivative products. Zero compensation. No moral rights waiver (better than Reddit—users retain attribution). Estimated value: 300M+ users × 10 Q&A/year = billions in training data."
    
  - term: "Batch Arbitration (NAM Mass Filing Rules)"
    definition: "Coordinated arbitration process for 25+ similar claims under NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules, featuring staged bellwether arbitrations and global mediation, but NOT class arbitration."
    references: "Section 11.5"
    user_impact: "Coordination without consolidation: individual claims, separate arbitrators, individual judgments. Bellwether cases (10-15 proceed first) inform remaining claims but not binding. Mediation opportunity after bellwether results. Users still pay individually (~$1.2K-$5.4K). Benefits Quora: manages mass filings without class action exposure. Mirage of collective action—procedural management tool, not substitute for class actions."

additional_observations:
  - title: "Privacy Disputes INCLUDED in Arbitration = Unprecedented Overreach"
    description: "Quora explicitly states 'disputes relating to your privacy rights are NOT EXCEPTED from this binding arbitration section'—most aggressive arbitration extension encountered. Privacy violations (data breaches, unauthorized surveillance, CCPA/GDPR violations) must be arbitrated individually. Bars public interest privacy litigation. Contrast: Mistral AI preserves GDPR supervisory authority pathways; Reddit exempts EEA users; Wikimedia allows privacy class actions (despite CA venue burden). Quora eliminates ALL collective privacy litigation for US/Canada users."
    
  - title: "40/F Score = Third-Lowest, But Lowest Dispute Resolution (25/F)"
    description: "Quora achieves 40/100 (F)—third-lowest overall score (Apple 30/F, Reddit 35/F, Quora 40/F, YouTube 45/F, Mistral AI 55/F, Wikimedia 65/D). However, Dispute Resolution category = 25/F (LOWEST across all platforms). Reflects comprehensive arbitration architecture: class waiver + jury waiver + privacy arbitration + batch provisions. Procedural disempowerment (arbitration barriers) rather than substantive exploitation (liability caps, training licenses)."
    
  - title: "Batch Arbitration = Mirage of Collective Action"
    description: "NAM Mass Filing Rules provide coordination (staged bellwether cases, mediation) BUT explicitly NOT class arbitration. Users still proceed individually—separate arbitrators, individual judgments, individual costs (~$1.2K-$5.4K each). Bellwether results non-binding precedent. Benefits Quora: manages mass filings without aggregated liability. Limited user benefit: shared discovery/strategy but economic irrationality persists for small claims."
    
  - title: "Perpetual License = Industry Standard Exploitation (Not Quora-Specific)"
    description: "Quora's perpetual license mirrors YouTube, Apple, Reddit, Mistral AI (Free Services)—industry-wide pattern. No moral rights waiver (better than Reddit). Estimated value extraction: 300M+ users × 10 Q&A/year = 3B Q&A pairs × $10M-$100M training data value + $200M-$500M advertising revenue. Zero user compensation (perpetual, royalty-free). Wikimedia exception: CC BY-SA 4.0 licenses to public (not exclusively to platform)."
    
  - title: "Two-Tiered Justice System: US/Canada Arbitration vs. International California Courts"
    description: "US/Canada users (50%, est. 150M): arbitration eliminates collective action, jury trial, privacy litigation. Cost barrier $1.2K-$5.4K exceeds most claims. International users (50%, est. 150M): California jurisdiction requires travel ($2K-$5K+), enforcement challenges. Both tiers create negative expected value for small claims. Contrast: Reddit exempts EEA users; Mistral AI provides Paris courts for French users. Quora provides NO meaningful access tier."
    
  - title: "Jury Trial Waiver = Constitutional Right Surrender"
    description: "Seventh Amendment protection eliminated. Community judgment (6-12 jurors) replaced by single arbitrator. Studies show arbitrators award 50-70% of jury damages. No public accountability (private proceeding, confidential decision). Appeals barred (only manifest disregard of law). Repeat player effect: arbitrators favor defendants. Combined with class waiver + privacy arbitration, completes comprehensive procedural disempowerment."
    
  - title: "30-Day Arbitration Opt-Out = Illusory Escape Hatch"
    description: "Users can reject arbitration by sending written notice to physical address within 30 days of account creation. Opt-out barriers: awareness (requires reading 131 sections), timing (30-day window), format (written notice), burden (affirmative action), partial escape (perpetual license + indemnification still apply). Industry opt-out rate <0.01% (less than 1 in 10,000 users). Default = arbitration acceptance."
    
  - title: "Automated Score (52/F) vs. Manual Score (40/F) = 12-Point Divergence"
    description: "Automated 52/F (82 rights index divergence) vs. manual 40/F = 12-point gap (smallest among arbitration platforms: YouTube 42-point, Mistral AI 21-point, Reddit 25-point). Automated detected arbitration keywords (176 mentions) but missed COMPREHENSIVENESS (class waiver + jury waiver + privacy arbitration). Manual analysis reveals procedural barriers harder to quantify than substantive harms (liability caps, training licenses have numerical values; arbitration architecture requires qualitative assessment)."
    
  - title: "Dispute Resolution Category (25/F) = Lowest Across All Platforms"
    description: "Comparison: Quora 25/F (NAM/AAA + class waiver + jury waiver + privacy arbitration) < Reddit 35/F (US arbitration, EEA exempt) < Apple 40/F (vague not sue) < Mistral AI 40/F (ICC $30K-$115K but French courts + GDPR pathways) < YouTube 45/F (AAA + $500 cap) < Wikimedia 50/F (CA courts, class actions allowed). Quora scores lowest because eliminates MORE rights (privacy litigation + collective action + jury trial) across MORE user populations (US/Canada arbitration, international CA courts) than any other platform."
    
  - title: "No Explicit Liability Cap (Yet Arbitration Limits Recovery)"
    description: "Unlike Mistral AI (€100/€10K explicit), YouTube ($500 explicit), Reddit ($100 explicit), Quora cap amount unknown. Likely AS IS disclaimers + consequential damages exclusions present. Arbitration clause + class waiver + jury waiver create comprehensive liability shield even without explicit cap. Class waiver prevents aggregation (e.g., 1M users × $10 damages = $10M claim barred)."

      impact: "US users face maximum $100 recovery for ALL CLAIMS combined (data breach + service outage + discrimination = $100 total). Data breach affecting 100M users → $100 per user (vs. $1,000-$10,000 actual identity theft damages). Inadequate for service disruption ($10,000-$100,000 business losses), emotional distress ($1,000-$50,000), consequential damages. Single recovery exhausts ALL liability permanently."
      affected_users: "US users (478M platform, ~60% US = 287M users)"
      comparison: "Pinterest/Reddit $100 (lowest) < Mistral AI €100 < YouTube $500 < Wikimedia $1,000 < Quora undisclosed"
    
    - concern: "Conditional Business Indemnification Trap"
      severity: "Critical"
      impact: "Business users monetizing Pinterest (affiliate links, sponsored content, product sales) WITHOUT signing Business Terms face UNLIMITED indemnification liability. User must pay Pinterest's legal defense costs ($50,000-$200,000 attorney fees) + settlement/judgment ($25,000-$50,000+) for ANY third-party claim (IP infringement, defamation, false advertising). Small creators earning $500-$50,000/year face financial ruin from single lawsuit. Business Terms requirement HIDDEN in Section 2(c) - no warning at monetization."
      affected_users: "Small business creators, influencers, affiliate marketers (estimated 5-10M US creators)"
      example: "Fashion blogger posts pin with $50 affiliate commission → Manufacturer sues Pinterest for trademark infringement → Blogger owes $100,000 (Pinterest's legal fees $75K + settlement $25K) → Blogger bankrupts"
    
    - concern: "Comprehensive Arbitration Architecture (Five-Layer Barrier)"
      severity: "Critical"
      impact: "US users face: (1) 60-day pre-arbitration notice (8 required fields, administrative burden), (2) AAA arbitration costs ($5K-$50K total), (3) Class action waiver (no collective redress for systematic harms), (4) Jury trial waiver (private arbitrator vs. constitutional jury right), (5) Frivolous claim fee shifting (user risks paying Pinterest's $50K attorney fees). Combined with $100 cap = negative expected value (spend $5K-$50K to recover $100 maximum). Economic irrationality deters 99%+ of legitimate claims."
      affected_users: "US users only (EEA/UK exempt)"
      cost_breakdown: "Filing $200-$400 + Arbitrator $1K-$5K + Attorney $5K-$50K + Risk of fee-shifting $10K-$100K = Total $6K-$155K exposure for $100 cap dispute"
    
    - concern: "Two-Tiered Justice System (US vs. EEA/UK)"
      severity: "High"
      impact: "Systematic discrimination: US users face $100 cap + forced arbitration + class waiver + California jurisdiction. EEA/UK users retain foreseeable damages (proportional to harm), local courts, class actions, jury rights (where applicable), local jurisdiction. Regulatory arbitrage - Pinterest exploits US legal gaps while EU Consumer Rights Directive prohibits worst provisions."
      affected_users: "287M US users face exploitation; 191M non-US users protected (estimate 40% EEA/UK)"
      legal_basis: "EU Consumer Rights Directive prohibits mandatory arbitration + unfair contract terms + excessive liability limitations"
    
    - concern: "Ambiguous Content License Duration (Perpetual via Survival?)"
      severity: "High"
      impact: "ToS DOES NOT explicitly state 'perpetual' or 'irrevocable' license (unique improvement vs. competitors).

additional_observations:
  - observation: "No Explicit Perpetual License (Unique Improvement)"
    details: "Pinterest ToS DOES NOT state 'perpetual' or 'irrevocable' license—unlike Quora/YouTube/Reddit/Apple/Mistral AI explicit perpetual licenses. However, Section 7 survival clause ('Sections 3... continue operative') creates ambiguity. Content license in Section 3 → may survive via survival clause. Two interpretations: (1) License terminates on account deletion (user-favorable, general contract law principle), (2) License survives via Section 7 (Pinterest-favorable, explicit survival language). Ambiguity benefits Pinterest (users assume termination while Pinterest argues survival). Recommendation: Users assume worst-case (perpetual via survival) when posting original creative work."
    comparative_analysis:
      - "Pinterest: NO explicit perpetual clause (ambiguous via survival)"
      - "Quora: 'perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide' (explicit)"

      - "Wikimedia: CC BY-SA 4.0 (public license, inherently perpetual)"
  
  - observation: "Conditional Indemnification Trap for Small Creators"
    details: "Section 8 creates hidden liability for business users monetizing Pinterest (affiliate links, sponsored pins, product sales) WITHOUT Business Terms Agreement. Trap elements: (1) Business Terms requirement BURIED in Section 2(c) - users skip to Section 3 content license, (2) No warning at monetization - Pinterest doesn't notify when first affiliate link added, (3) Indemnification UNLIMITED - no cap, covers ANY claim (IP, defamation, false advertising, consumer protection), (4) Targets vulnerable creators - small businesses/influencers earning $500-$50,000/year. Example: Fashion blogger posts pin with $50 affiliate link → Manufacturer sues Pinterest for trademark infringement → Pinterest's legal defense $75K + settlement $25K → Blogger owes $100K total → Bankrupts."
    predatory_design: "Business Terms requirement hidden + no monetization warning + unlimited liability + vulnerable target population = systematic exploitation of small creators"

OneTrust cookie consent SDK code (ot-sdk-cookie-policy:314, onetrust-consent-sdk:108, consent:125) + CSS classes (border-color:83, auto:78) + HTML elements (label:89, item:83, policy:355) = ~400-500 artifacts (60-76% of 657 uncommon terms). Automated Flesch treats technical code as prose → 'ot-sdk-cookie-policy' = 7 syllables → catastrophic syllables-per-word ratio → negative score. Actual legal prose Flesch estimated 10-20 (Very Difficult) after filtering—comparable to Reddit 14.68, Quora 5.14. Lesson: Negative Flesch indicates data quality issues, not genuine complexity.

  - observation: "Two-Tiered Justice System (US Exploitation vs. EU Protection)"
    details: "Pinterest implements systematic discrimination between US and European users. US users: $100 aggregate cap + AAA arbitration ($5K-$50K costs) + class waiver + jury waiver + California jurisdiction (travel costs) = comprehensive disempowerment. EEA/UK users: Foreseeable damages ($1K-$50K proportional) + local courts + class actions permitted + jury rights (where applicable) + local jurisdiction (convenient forum). Regulatory arbitrage: Pinterest exploits US legal gaps (no federal prohibition on mandatory arbitration, class waivers, excessive caps) while EU Consumer Rights Directive prohibits worst provisions. Business model depends on US exploitation: 287M US users × $100 cap = $28.7B platform facing maximum $28.7M liability ($100 × 287M) for systematic harm."
    legal_basis_divergence:
      us: "No federal consumer protection law prohibiting mandatory arbitration, class waivers, liability caps. FAA (Federal Arbitration Act) enforces arbitration clauses."
      eu: "Consumer Rights Directive prohibits mandatory arbitration for consumers. Unfair Contract Terms Directive prohibits excessive liability limitations. GDPR provides parallel enforcement (up to 4% global revenue)."
  
  - observation: "Batched Arbitration: Progressive Reform OR Coordination Trap?"
    details: "Pinterest's batched arbitration provision (Section 11) unique among reviewed platforms. Enables economies of scale: 50+ similar demands within 60 days → AAA consolidates → one arbitrator, one fee set per side → reduces per-claim costs from $5K-$50K to $1K-$5K (shared). Benefits mass disputes (data breach, systematic discrimination, widespread fraud). However, coordination barriers limit effectiveness: (1) 50-demand threshold requires organized coordination, (2) 60-day window tight timeline (users discovering breach months later miss batch), (3) Same law firm requirement (individual pro se users NOT batched), (4) Similarity dispute submitted to arbitrator whose fees Pinterest pays (conflict of interest—arbitrator incentivized to split batches = higher fees). Real-world impact: Law firm representing 100+ data breach victims benefits; individual users filing separately pay full costs."
    progressive_or_trap: "Progressive intent (reduces costs for organized users) BUT coordination requirements create access barrier for individuals. Effectiveness depends on sophisticated legal representation unavailable to typical users."
  
  - observation: "Frivolous Claim Fee Shifting: Chilling Effect Quantified"
    details: "Section 11 fee-shifting provision creates $10K-$100K risk deterring legitimate claims. Example: User files $1,000 data breach claim (identity theft potential) → Pinterest argues 'frivolous' (no actual theft yet, only risk) → Arbitrator sides with Pinterest (subjective 'frivolous' standard, no ToS definition) → User owes $400 filing + $3,000 arbitrator + $50,000 Pinterest attorney fees = $53,400 TOTAL. Chilling effect: Users with legitimate but uncertain claims avoid arbitration (fear of fee liability exceeds potential recovery). Pro se litigants disproportionately harmed (don't understand 'frivolous' standard). Low-value claims deterred ($100-$1,000 recovery not worth $10K-$100K risk). Arbitrators incentivized to find frivolousness (fee-shifting increases arbitrator compensation—user pays arbitrator's own fees = conflict of interest)."
    chilling_effect_math: "Expected value calculation: $1,000 potential recovery - $53,400 risk (if deemed frivolous) × 10% probability = -$4,340 expected value. Rational user avoids arbitration."

final_assessment:
  overall: "Pinterest Terms of Service represent systematic user disempowerment rivaling Big Tech giants despite brand positioning as 'positive inspiration' platform. 38/100 score (second-lowest, only Apple 30/F worse) reflects: (1) $100 aggregate liability cap tied for lowest with Reddit (grossly inadequate for 478M-user platform), (2) Comprehensive five-layer arbitration architecture (60-day notice + AAA costs + class waiver + jury waiver + fee-shifting) creating economic irrationality ($5K-$50K costs to recover $100 maximum), (3) Conditional business indemnification trap targeting small creators (unlimited liability for commercial use without Business Terms), (4) Two-tiered justice system (US exploitation vs. EEA/UK protection via Consumer Rights Directive), (5) Ambiguous content license duration (no explicit perpetual but likely via Section 7 survival clause)."
  
  business_model_exploitation: "Pinterest monetization depends on US user disempowerment: 287M US users × $100 cap = maximum $28.7M liability for platform-wide systematic harm (data breach, algorithm discrimination, service failure). Actual damages $1K-$10K per user = $287B-$2.87T total harm → capped at $28.7M (0.01-0.1% of actual damages). Arbitration architecture eliminates 99%+ of claims via economic irrationality. Indemnification transfers creator liability to users while Pinterest profits from user-generated content. EEA/UK carve-out demonstrates Pinterest CAN provide protections (foreseeable damages, courts, no arbitration) but CHOOSES exploitation where legally permissible (US regulatory gaps)."
  
  modest_strengths: "Pinterest marginally better than worst competitors: (1) No explicit perpetual license (vs. Quora/YouTube/Reddit/Apple explicit perpetual), though survival clause ambiguity undermines benefit, (2) EEA/UK consumer protections (vs. YouTube/Quora universal arbitration), (3) Small claims court option (vs. Quora mandatory arbitration), (4) Batched arbitration efficiency for organized users (vs. individual arbitration costs), (5) 8 sections minimal fragmentation (vs. Quora 131, Mistral AI 207)."
  
  critical_weaknesses: "Tied-for-lowest $100 cap + five-layer arbitration barrier + conditional indemnification trap + survival clause ambiguity + two-tiered justice = comprehensive disempowerment. Artifact-driven -218.94 Flesch score (worst ever) obscures actual complexity but creates procedural access barrier (users can't read terms to understand rights)."
  
  recommendations_for_users:
    creators: "SIGN BUSINESS TERMS AGREEMENT immediately if monetizing (avoid unlimited indemnification trap). Assume perpetual license (don't post original creative work intended for independent monetization). Use watermarks, low-resolution uploads."
    us_consumers: "Avoid high-value claims ($100 cap makes arbitration economically irrational). Document evidence meticulously (minimize frivolous claim risk). Consider CCPA/state consumer protection claims (may avoid arbitration). Delete account if privacy-conscious (though license may survive)."
    eea_uk_consumers: "Leverage GDPR + Consumer Rights Directive protections. Threaten local court litigation + regulatory complaints to negotiate settlements. Assert foreseeable damages standard (avoid $100 cap). Document harms comprehensively."
    small_businesses: "Sign Business Terms Agreement before first monetization. Review indemnification insurance ($1M-$5M coverage). Consult attorney for IP clearance (avoid third-party infringement triggering indemnification)."

  overall_summary: |-
    Verified SAM.gov Terms capture confirms governance-oriented rights environment: public domain federal content, absence of arbitration or perpetual user content licensing, structured restrictions on misuse, and explicit data source licensing (D&B). Monitoring banner and CUI/PII handling requirements diminish privacy expectations and shift compliance burdens to users. Lack of effective date and version changelog undermine transparency. Modest score increase (64→66) driven by improved clarity and account governance articulation; core privacy and algorithmic transparency weaknesses persist.

  overall_summary: |-
    FamilySearch attains a 62/D—second only to Wikimedia (65/D) in this corpus—by forgoing arbitration and class waivers while providing unusually explicit disclosure of collaboration with commercial genealogical organizations. That surface transparency is undermined by an expansive perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license granting 'any and all purposes' use with derivative and downstream commercialization potential and no attribution duty. Combined with a functional $0 liability cap ('amount paid… if any') and Utah-only venue, enforcement pathways become economically irrational. Mandatory binary sex labeling and unrestricted sharing of living persons' genealogical data create privacy and representation risks. Nonprofit status does not materially restrain exploitation vectors introduced by sublicensing and derivative rights. Reform should focus on reversible or time-limited licensing, opt-outs for commercial data pooling, structured export guarantees, and minimum preservation/accountability commitments.
