**Overall Readability Grade:** F (Very Hard)

## 3. User Rights Index (Manual)

| Category | Manual Score (0-100) | Grade | Key Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clarity & Transparency | 45 | D | Heavy reliance on cross-linked AWS policies; key obligations buried in multi-clause paragraphs (Sections 2, 12). |
| Data Collection & Use | 50 | D+ | Privacy Notice governs all data, plus explicit sharing with coordinators and derived biometrics from recordings (Sections 3.1-3.3, 4.3). |
| User Privacy | 40 | D- | Broad voice/image retention rights, limited opt-outs beyond withdrawal; minors must rely on anonymous accounts but still subject to sharing (Sections 4.2-4.3, 6.2). |
| Content Rights | 30 | F | Perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license plus moral rights waiver over "Recordings" and learner material (Section 4.2). |
| Account Management | 55 | C- | Learners can withdraw (Section 8.1) yet AWS may suspend access unilaterally for broad reasons (Section 2.3). |
| Dispute Resolution | 60 | C | Disputes defer to AWS Customer Agreement and regional addenda; no arbitration mandate but forum selection tied to contracting party (Section 12.5). |
| Terms Changes | 35 | F | AWS may modify terms at any time by posting; continued participation implies consent (Section 12.7). |
| Algorithmic Decisions | 50 | C | No explicit algorithmic transparency; some automated sorting described for Job Board with disclaimers (Section 6.4.2). |

**Weighted URI Score (Manual):** 45

**Guardrail Notes:** Elevated risk around mandatory license to learner likeness/content, unilateral suspension, and minimal notice before future changes. Additional caution for programs involving minors and Job Board exposure.

## 4. Overall Summary

AWS’s learner terms centralize control with AWS, granting it broad rights to capture, reuse, and disseminate participant recordings and materials with minimal opt-out. The agreement leans heavily on other AWS policies, making it difficult for learners to interpret data handling or dispute pathways without cross-referencing multiple documents. Learners bear responsibility for compliance and risk suspension or loss of access if AWS perceives security or commercial misuse. While the document covers international participation and age brackets in detail, it offers limited assurances on privacy, change control, or liability beyond statutory minimums.

### Section: 1. AWS Training
- **Manual Risk Level:** Low
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Clarity & Transparency
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Establishes that the terms cover AWS-provided digital and in-person training, including Cloud Institute offerings.
  - Clarifies that additional program-specific policies may supplement the master terms.
- **Manual Notes:** Functions as scope and definitions section; risk arises mainly if users overlook referenced policies.

### Section: 2. Access and Use
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Clarity & Transparency, Terms Changes, Account Management
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - License is revocable and conditioned on strict compliance; AWS can suspend access for broad security or liability concerns.
  - Prohibits any production or commercial use of training content and bans introducing regulated data.
- **Manual Notes:** Learners must monitor multiple AWS policies simultaneously; suspension criteria include subjective determinations of “security risk.”

### Section: 3. Your Information
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Data Collection & Use, User Privacy
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - All personal data processing defers to AWS Privacy Notice with limited detail in the terms themselves.
  - Training data may be shared with third-party coordinators for marketing additional AWS training.
- **Manual Notes:** Lacks granular consent management; coordination sharing may expand profiling beyond learner expectations.

### Section: 4. Live AWS Training; Recordings and Your Materials
- **Manual Risk Level:** High
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Content Rights, User Privacy, Data Collection & Use
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Participants grant perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to AWS for all recordings and submitted materials, including moral rights waiver.
  - AWS may derive biometric data (voice, image) and retain/use it per Privacy Notice without additional consent.
- **Manual Notes:** No opt-out for recordings besides non-participation; clause applies broadly to "any AWS Cloud Institute activity." Significant rights transfer with limited safeguards.

### Section: 5. Betas and Previews
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Content Rights, Terms Changes
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Beta and preview offerings may change or terminate without notice, and AWS provides them "as is" with limited commitments.
  - Learners must keep "Test Observations" confidential and cannot benchmark or disclose performance data.
- **Manual Notes:** Confidentiality and rapid change clauses increase risk for institutions relying on beta curriculum; ensure teams understand disclosure limits.

### Section: 6. Special Terms for AWS Education Programs
- **Manual Risk Level:** High
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** User Privacy, Account Management, Algorithmic Decisions
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Age-based participation rules require guardian involvement or anonymous IDs for minors and permit data sharing with coordinators.
  - Program-specific clauses (Academy, Educate, Job Board, re/Start, Skills Centers) expand data use, marketing outreach, and job matching automation.
- **Manual Notes:** Job Board algorithms publicly expose learner profiles; coordinators may process personal data beyond core training delivery—verify compliance agreements.

### Section: 7. Taxes
- **Manual Risk Level:** Low
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Account Management
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Learners are responsible for any applicable taxes and must provide accurate tax-related information upon request.
  - AWS may collect taxes where required and pass through third-party charges.
- **Manual Notes:** Standard cost allocation clause; low rights risk unless learners misreport status.

### Section: 8. Cancellation and Withdrawal
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Account Management, Terms Changes
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Learners can withdraw, but refunds depend on separate site-specific policies.
  - AWS may cancel trainings at any time with limited liability, even when access is through third-party providers.
- **Manual Notes:** Post-cancellation obligations persist (Sections 2-13), keeping restrictive clauses in force.

### Section: 9. Trade Compliance and Ethics
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Account Management, Clarity & Transparency
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Participants must comply with U.S. export controls and certify they are not on restricted-party lists.
  - Ethics clause prohibits bribery or improper payments connected to AWS training engagements.
- **Manual Notes:** Non-compliance can trigger immediate suspension; organizations should vet attendees for sanction risks.

### Section: 10. Disclaimers
- **Manual Risk Level:** High
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Liability & Remedies
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Training is provided without warranties, including accuracy or fitness for purpose, and may include third-party content.
  - AWS disclaims responsibility for interruptions, errors, and data loss associated with training use.
- **Manual Notes:** Reinforces need for independent validation of training outputs before production use.

### Section: 11. Limitations of Liability
- **Manual Risk Level:** High
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Dispute Resolution, Liability & Remedies
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Liability capped at redelivery of training or $100; excludes indirect and consequential damages.
  - Carve-outs for certain jurisdictions exist but require user diligence to interpret.
- **Manual Notes:** Remedy cap is low relative to potential professional or privacy losses; learners shoulder most risk.

### Section: 12. Miscellaneous
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Dispute Resolution, Clarity & Transparency
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Force majeure, assignment limits, and third-party beneficiary disclaimers consolidate AWS contractual leverage.
  - Contracting-party matrix and governing-law provisions vary by geography, while country-specific addenda may override baseline terms.
- **Manual Notes:** Customers operating globally must map the correct AWS entity and local variations to maintain compliance.

### Section: 12.7 Modifications to these Terms
- **Manual Risk Level:** Medium
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Terms Changes, Clarity & Transparency
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - AWS can alter terms unilaterally with immediate effect upon posting.
  - Continued participation equals acceptance; no guaranteed advance notice except in targeted jurisdictions (e.g., Australia).
- **Manual Notes:** Requires learners to self-monitor for updates; no built-in notification mechanism for global users.

### Section: 13. Definitions
- **Manual Risk Level:** Low
- **Rights Categories Impacted:** Clarity & Transparency
- **Key Takeaways:** 
  - Consolidates defined terms (e.g., "AWS Training", "Coordinator", "Recordings") that govern obligations throughout the agreement.
  - Clarifies that capitalized terms align with AWS Customer Agreement when not explicitly defined.
- **Manual Notes:** Helpful reference but demands cross-reading with other AWS legal documents to grasp full scope.

## 6. Uncommon / Legal Terms Requiring Definitions

| Term | Manual Definition / Context | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Recordings" | Audio/visual captures of learners taken during AWS classroom or institute trainings, licensed to AWS for perpetual reuse. | Section 4.2 |
| "Coordinator" | Third party (employer, educator, vendor) arranging learner participation and receiving training data from AWS. | Section 3.2 |
| "Beta Service" | Pre-release training features offered “as is” with confidentiality requirements on user feedback. | Section 5 |

## 7. Additional Observations

- Multiple cross-references (AWS Privacy Notice, Responsible AI Policy, Service Terms) require learners to navigate additional documents to understand obligations.
- Age-specific table improves transparency for minors but still defers to anonymous login rather than offering formal parental consent flows.
- Job Board language (Section 6.4) highlights automated profiling and public exposure risks; consider separate disclosure when enabling that feature.
