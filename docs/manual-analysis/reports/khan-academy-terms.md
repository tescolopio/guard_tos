## 2. Readability

| Metric | Score | Grade | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flesch Reading Ease | 48.45 | F | 24k-word agreement with layered role-based obligations and dense compliance carve-outs for schools and parents. |
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level | 11.18 | D | Long sentences, statutory citations (COPPA/FERPA), and multi-step consent workflows demand college-level reading. |
| Gunning Fog Index | 16.99 | Graduate | Heavy legal terminology around arbitration, licenses, and education law inflates conceptual load. |

## 3. User Rights Index (Manual)

| Category | Manual Score (0-100) | Grade | Key Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clarity & Transparency | 55 | C | Up-front summaries help, yet critical duties are split across base terms, privacy policies, and school addenda. |
| Data Collection & Use | 60 | C | Privacy handled via separate policy; integrated services and linked accounts expand data sharing with limited in-document detail. |
| User Privacy | 58 | C | Offers deletion/contact pathways and supervision guidance, but broad analytics permissions remain. |
| Content Rights | 45 | D | Users retain ownership, yet Khan Academy receives perpetual licenses (including AI output reuse) and strong curation controls. |
| Account Management | 50 | D+ | Self-service cancellation exists, but unilateral suspension and repeat-infringer rules are expansive. |
| Dispute Resolution | 30 | F | Binding arbitration with class-action waiver and limited fee shifting; venue centered in California. |
| Terms Changes | 45 | D | Updates may take effect immediately for new functions; schools get limited opt-out via notice. |
| Algorithmic Decisions | 45 | D | Khanmigo disclosure urges supervision but provides little transparency into decision logic or redress. |

**Weighted URI Score (Manual):** 52

**Guardrail Notes:** Arbitration waiver and class-action prohibition narrow remedies; perpetual content license (including AI-derived output) and school-consent obligations warrant compliance tracking; institutions must document COPPA/FERPA authorizations to avoid breach.

## 4. Overall Summary

Khan Academy’s Terms of Service blend learner-friendly goals with institutional compliance requirements. While users keep ownership of submissions, Khan Academy secures broad rights to host, analyze, and adapt content—extending to AI-generated output and educational materials. Parents, schools, and coaches face detailed consent and supervision duties, particularly when enabling linked or anonymized student accounts. Dispute options are tightly constrained by mandatory arbitration and class-action waivers, and change-management provisions allow rapid updates. Organizations adopting Khan Academy should inventory linked policies, confirm data-sharing authorizations, and prepare escalation paths that satisfy both education law and arbitration prerequisites.

## 6. Uncommon / Legal Terms Requiring Definitions

| Term | Manual Definition / Context | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "School Consent" | Confirmation that a school obtained parental/guardian permission or qualifies for a statutory exception (e.g., COPPA school official) before enabling student accounts. | Section 1.6 |
| "Linked Accounts" | Combined personal and school accounts that permanently share learning history and access credentials. | Section 1.8 |
| "Khanmigo" | Khan Academy’s AI-enabled tutoring assistant governed by the same content, beta, and supervision restrictions as the base service. | Section 1.12 |

## 7. Additional Observations

- Arbitration requires a formal Notice of Dispute with a proposed resolution; failing to document the 60-day negotiation window could forfeit claims.
- Institutions should coordinate privacy impact assessments, as integrated services and linked accounts expand data flows beyond the core platform.
- Cookie preference tooling provides granular control but depends on browser storage—implement supplemental consent solutions for devices managed by schools.
