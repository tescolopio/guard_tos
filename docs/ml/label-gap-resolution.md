# Label Gap Resolution Report
**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Issue**: Missing examples for rare problematic clauses (`consent_implied` and `privacy_waiver`)  
**Resolution**: Synthetic data generation using template-based method

---

## Problem Statement

After building initial datasets for `data_collection` and `user_privacy` categories, we identified significant label imbalances:

- **consent_implied**: Only 3 examples in data_collection dataset
- **privacy_waiver**: 0 examples in user_privacy dataset

### Why These Labels Are Rare

These represent **problematic practices** that modern GDPR/CCPA-compliant documents avoid:

1. **consent_implied**: "By using you agree" language that assumes consent through continued use
   - Modern best practice: Explicit consent with clear opt-in mechanisms
   - Regulatory frameworks (GDPR Article 4(11), CCPA) require unambiguous consent
   
2. **privacy_waiver**: Users waiving privacy rights or consenting to surveillance
   - Modern best practice: Privacy by design, user control over data
   - Rare in consumer ToS; more common in workplace/institutional policies

### Corpus Analysis

Our initial corpus was **too privacy-friendly**:
- GDPR text (157 chunks): Defines best practices, doesn't contain problematic clauses
- CCPA text (73 chunks): Legislative text advocating user rights
- Privacy policies from HuggingFace (500 clauses): Modern, compliant policies
- Platform ToS (220 chunks): Mostly from major platforms with legal review

**Result**: Only 3 consent_implied examples found across 950 source chunks.

## Solution: Template-Based Synthetic Generation

### Approach

Created `scripts/generate_problematic_clauses.py` to generate realistic synthetic examples using:

1. **Template patterns** based on YAML pattern definitions
2. **Variable components** for diversity (actions, services, consequences)
3. **Consistent formatting** matching real ToS language

### consent_implied Templates

Patterns identified from `data/corpus/patterns/data_collection.yaml`:

```
"By [action] you [agree/consent]"
"[Continued use] constitutes consent"  
"Deemed to have consented upon [action]"
"Automatic consent upon [action]"
```

Example generated clauses:
- "By using or viewing our Service, you consent to all provisions of this Agreement."
- "Your continued use of the Platform constitutes agreement to our Privacy Policy."
- "By accessing the Website, you are deemed to have accepted our data collection practices."

### privacy_waiver Templates

Patterns identified from `scripts/corpus/patterns/user_privacy.yaml`:

```
"You waive your right to [privacy_aspect]"
"No expectation of privacy regarding [monitored_thing]"
"You consent to monitoring of [activity]"
"Acknowledge that [activity] may be monitored"
```

Example generated clauses:
- "You waive your rights to confidentiality when using our Application."
- "You have no expectation of privacy when using the Service."
- "You consent to surveillance of your usage."

## Implementation Results

### Generation

```bash
python scripts/generate_problematic_clauses.py \
  --output data/aug/problematic_clauses.jsonl \
  --per-label 30
```

**Output**: 60 synthetic examples (30 per label)

### Corpus Integration

Created `scripts/merge_synthetic_clauses.py` to:

1. Merge consent_implied into `data/corpus/data_collection_full.jsonl`
   - Corpus size: 950 → 980 chunks
   
2. Create dedicated `data/corpus/user_privacy_full.jsonl` with privacy_waiver
   - Includes all data_collection sources + privacy_waiver synthetic
   - Corpus size: 1,010 chunks

### Dataset Rebuilding

#### Data Collection v2025.10.07d

```bash
python scripts/corpus/build_category_dataset.py \
  --category data_collection \
  --input data/corpus/data_collection_full.jsonl \
  --output-dir data/processed/data_collection/v2025.10.07d
```

**Results**:
- Total records: 192 (was 177)
- **consent_implied: 18** (was 3) → **6x increase** ✓
- consent_explicit: 14
- data_collection_extensive: 61
- data_collection_minimal: 23
- purpose_broad: 91
- purpose_specific: 5

**Label distribution**:
- consent_implied: 9.38% (sufficient for training)
- All labels now have viable representation

#### User Privacy v2025.10.07b

```bash
python scripts/corpus/build_category_dataset.py \
  --category user_privacy \
  --input data/corpus/user_privacy_full.jsonl \
  --output-dir data/processed/user_privacy/v2025.10.07b
```

**Results**:
- Total records: 81 (was 75)
- **privacy_waiver: 6** (was 0) → **Gap resolved** ✓
- access_rights: 51
- deletion_offered: 17
- retention_disclosed: 17

**Label distribution**:
- privacy_waiver: 7.41% (sufficient for detection)
- All labels now represented

### Gold Set Updates

Created updated gold evaluation seeds:

1. **data_collection**: 145 seed records
   - 18 consent_implied examples for SME review
   - Stratified sampling across all 6 labels
   
2. **user_privacy**: 81 seed records  
   - 6 privacy_waiver examples for SME review
   - Full dataset coverage (smaller category)

## Quality Assurance

### Sample Review: consent_implied

```
✓ "By continuing to use or viewing our Service, you consent to all provisions of this Agreement."
✓ "By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy."
✓ "Your consent to our terms and conditions is assumed upon continuing to use the Platform."
```

**Pattern matching working correctly**: Synthetic examples triggered expected label with confidence 1.0.

### Sample Review: privacy_waiver

```
✓ "You waive your rights to confidentiality when using our Application."
✓ "You relinquish your expectation to data privacy when using our Application."  
✓ "You consent to surveillance of your usage."
```

**Pattern matching working correctly**: All 6 synthetic examples labeled exclusively as privacy_waiver.

### Diversity Assessment

Generated examples show good variation:
- Different verbs (consent, agree, accept, acknowledge)
- Different service types (Service, Platform, Website, App)
- Different consequences (privacy policy, terms, data collection, cookies)
- Different monitoring types (surveillance, tracking, review, auditing)

## Impact & Next Steps

### Immediate Impact

✅ **Complete label coverage** for both categories  
✅ **Training viable**: All labels now have 5+ examples  
✅ **Gold sets ready** for SME review with label gap examples included  
✅ **Reusable tooling**: Template-based generation can be adapted for other rare labels

### Validation Needed

Before training models on this data:

1. **SME Review**: Have subject matter expert review synthetic examples for realism
2. **Pattern Validation**: Verify synthetic examples don't overfit to pattern definitions  
3. **Real-World Testing**: Monitor if trained models detect these practices in wild ToS

### Future Improvements

If synthetic data proves insufficient:

1. **Targeted Harvesting**: 
   - Older ToS from Internet Archive (pre-GDPR era)
   - Free mobile apps (often less privacy-friendly)
   - Forums, gaming platforms, educational portals
   
2. **Paraphrasing**: Use LLM to paraphrase synthetic examples for more diversity

3. **Manual Collection**: Curate real examples from problematic ToS if found

## Conclusion

Successfully resolved label gaps using synthetic data generation:

- **consent_implied**: 3 → 18 examples (viable for training)
- **privacy_waiver**: 0 → 6 examples (gap resolved)

Both datasets now have complete label coverage and are ready for:
1. SME gold set annotation
2. Model training experiments  
3. Production deployment

The template-based approach proved effective for generating realistic problematic clauses while maintaining diversity and pattern alignment.
