    <h1>Academia Commons Learning Platform Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      Academia Commons is a fictitious non-profit organization that provides free digital learning
      resources. This document exists purely to exercise our test suite. The language has been drafted
      uniquely for this repository and focuses on educational resources, volunteer contributions, and
      open licenses. Because our enhanced summarizer looks for headings and meaningful paragraph
      content, the introduction mixes practical guidance with legal triggers such as license
      information, notice requirements, and platform expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learners, teachers, and contributors agree to treat one another with respect and to use the
      platform in ways that further public education. While similar to many real-world policies, all
      details here are invented. The organization encourages forkable content and collaborative lesson
      plans and offers scholarships to educators who build accessible coursework. The terms also note
      that donations support infrastructure and moderation.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</h2>
    <p>
      Academia Commons respects intellectual property rights. If you believe your copyrighted material
      appears on the platform without authorization, you may submit a DMCA notice to our copyright
      agent. The notice must include your signature, identification of the work claimed to be
      infringed, identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, contact information,
      and a good-faith statement that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
      the law. We also outline our counter-notice procedure, emphasizing that repeated infringers may
      have their accounts terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section references safe harbor provisions and clarifies that, because the platform is
      educational, Copyright owners are encouraged to specify alternative licensing preferences. The
      combination of DMCA keywords and structural cues ensures this fixture supports the corresponding
      golden assertion in our tests.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimers; No Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      All educational content, practice exercises, and interactive tools are provided "as is" without
      warranties of any kind. Academia Commons disclaims implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
      for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We specifically note that lesson plans and
      volunteer-created modules may contain errors or outdated references. Learners are encouraged to
      verify information and to consult professionals for specialized advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform does not promise uninterrupted service. Maintenance periods, third-party outages,
      and curriculum updates can temporarily affect availability. We also explain that the organization
      may add optional premium services in the future but that such experiments do not alter the core
      mission of free access to quality education.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To make sure our enhanced summarizer recognizes liability language, we state that the total
      cumulative liability of Academia Commons for any claim will not exceed one hundred dollars. The
      organization is not responsible for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential
      damages. Examples include lost data, substitute services, or alleged harm from reliance on lesson
      content. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so certain limitations
      may not apply. Users agree to indemnify and hold the organization harmless from third-party claims
      related to their contributions.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Community Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Educators should provide accurate citations, avoid plagiarism, and obtain parental consent before
      collecting information from minors. The platform reserves the right to remove content that
      conflicts with its mission or that violates applicable law. We offer a responsive feedback process
      and publish transparency reports about content moderation. These details add volume and extra
      headings for the summarizer to analyze.
