    <h1>GitLink Developer Platform Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      These synthetic terms describe how the fictional GitLink service allows developers to collaborate
      on projects, publish code, and review changes. The scenario mirrors a modern code hosting service
      but is written entirely from scratch for testing purposes. The language purposefully mentions core
      ideas such as repositories, pull requests, and shared infrastructure while avoiding references to
      any real policy text. This introduction alone uses more than one hundred characters to help reach
      the required length for robust summarization tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using GitLink, you acknowledge that these terms form a binding agreement between you and the
      platform operator. You also confirm that you have the authority to accept these obligations on
      behalf of your organization. Throughout this document we refer to the person or entity using the
      service as the "Developer." The platform is designed for collaborative coding, continuous
      integration workflows, and transparent review of software changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The GitLink services, including public repositories, internal automation, and any optional
      beta features, are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To make the disclaimer
      explicit, we state that the company disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express,
      implied, statutory, or otherwise. This includes but is not limited to warranties of
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement.
      We also clarify that no oral or written information will create a new warranty. Developers are
      responsible for ensuring that code deployed from GitLink meets their own quality standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disclaimer continues: GitLink does not guarantee uninterrupted uptime or error-free operation.
      Maintenance windows may occur without advance notice, and data synchronization delays may result.
      Because of the collaborative nature of the platform, the company cannot control how other
      developers use or modify code that you publish. The service may occasionally surface community
      contributions that you should review carefully before merging into production systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure our summarizer sees a clear limitation of liability clause, this section states that the
      platform operator will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
      exemplary damages. That includes damages for lost profits, goodwill, use, or data, even if the
      company has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The total cumulative liability for
      all claims related to the service will not exceed the greater of twenty-five U.S. dollars ($25) or
      the amounts paid by the Developer to GitLink within the twelve months preceding the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional wording clarifies that certain jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
      warranties or the exclusion of liability for consequential damages, so some of the above
      limitations may not apply. However, GitLink strives to maintain reasonable safeguards, detailed
      audit trails, and industry-standard encryption to minimize risk. These paragraphs provide enough
      textual context for the enhanced summarizer to tag the section with
      <strong>LIABILITY_AND_REMEDIES</strong> and similar hints.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      This agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
      California, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties agree that the federal
      and state courts located in San Francisco County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over
      any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms. Developers waive any objections to venue or
      inconvenient forum in those courts. This paragraph includes the phrase "governing law" multiple
      times to make automated detection straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide additional context, we explain that California law is chosen because the fictional
      company maintains its principal place of business there and because many developers who use the
      platform are based in that jurisdiction. The clause also notes that the United Nations Convention
      on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. Together, these sentences ensure
      a comprehensive sample for testing governing-law detection and risk evaluation logic.
    </p>

    <h2>Export Controls and Community Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      Developers agree not to use the platform in violation of applicable export control laws. They also
      agree to follow community guidelines that prohibit harassment, hate speech, and the posting of
      malicious code. Accounts that repeatedly violate the guidelines may be suspended or terminated.
      This extra section provides filler content to comfortably exceed the thousand-character threshold
      and to ensure the summarizer handles multiple headings in a single document.
