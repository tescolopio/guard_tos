    <h1>Pinsprout Community Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>
      Pinsprout is a fictional inspiration-sharing network created to validate our automated legal
      summarizer. Members save design ideas, recipes, and educational tutorials to boards that can be
      public or private. These terms are original prose written solely for quality assurance and do not
      replicate any real policy language. The lengthy sentences in this introduction help inflate the
      document size so that each fixture comfortably exceeds one thousand characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create an account you agree to provide accurate information, respect intellectual
      property rights, and comply with applicable laws. You also agree that Pinsprout may send service
      announcements and updates related to safety, accessibility, and new features. Because the network
      involves user-generated content, we emphasize moderation guidelines and clear processes for
      reporting harmful material.
    </p>

    <h2>Mandatory Arbitration Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure the test evaluates dispute-resolution detection, we declare that any controversy or
      claim arising out of or relating to these terms will be resolved through binding arbitration
      administered by a neutral provider. The arbitration will follow streamlined rules designed for
      technology services. Both parties agree to submit disputes on an individual basis and to allow the
      arbitrator authority to award equitable relief. This sentence explicitly references an
      <strong>arbitration</strong> requirement so the enhanced summarizer will categorize the section as
      dispute resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreement also covers billing concerns, intellectual property claims, and alleged breaches of
      community guidelines. Hearings may be conducted remotely, and either party can request a written
      decision explaining the award. The text highlights that arbitration decisions are final and
      enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      Each party expressly waives the right to pursue or participate in class actions, class
      arbitrations, collective actions, representative proceedings, or private attorney-general actions
      related to Pinsprout. Disputes must be brought only on an individual basis, and the arbitrator may
      award relief only on behalf of the individual party seeking relief. This class action waiver is
      reiterated in several sentences so that automated classifiers clearly identify the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiver applies even if the arbitration provider's rules would otherwise permit consolidation.
      In the unlikely event this waiver is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration clause will be
      severed, and disputes will proceed in the courts described below. The repeated use of the phrase
      "class action" helps the test confirm that category hints for DISPUTE_RESOLUTION and CLASS_ACTIONS
      are both surfaced in the summarizer output.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law and Venue</h2>
    <p>
      These terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding conflict-of-law
      principles. If a dispute cannot be arbitrated for any reason, the parties submit to the personal
      and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York.
      We specify that venue and governing law are linked concepts so the fixture clearly resembles an
      actual policy. Users consent to service of process by email and waive objections based on
      inconvenient forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section also notes that Pinsprout's headquarters are located in New York, that the service is
      tailored to U.S. law, and that international users should review additional local guidelines. The
      United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. These
      details not only expand the paragraph length but also provide more context for risk analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>Community Well-Being</h2>
    <p>
      Pinsprout encourages inclusive design and prohibits content that promotes violence, hate, or
      dangerous activities. The company may remove content or suspend accounts to protect users or
      comply with legal requests. This extra section is included to raise the character count and to
      offer additional headings for the summarizer to analyze.
