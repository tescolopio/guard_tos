    <h1>ForumVerse Community User Agreement</h1>
    <p>
      ForumVerse is a fictional discussion network designed to test our legal summarization pipeline.
      Users create communities, post stories, and moderate conversations. The text in this agreement is
      entirely bespoke. It describes how moderators and participants interact, how content is ranked,
      and how users can appeal moderation decisions. We include numerous sentences to ensure the HTML
      length exceeds the minimum threshold used in the golden tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you access ForumVerse you accept these terms and confirm that you are at least thirteen
      years old. You agree to comply with community rules, content policies, and local laws. We also
      mention our transparency center, volunteer moderator program, and automated tooling that flags
      potentially harmful content for review.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. ForumVerse disclaims all
      warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
      accuracy, and non-infringement. Because community posts come from users, the platform cannot
      guarantee the truthfulness or reliability of any content. We specifically note that users should
      exercise caution before relying on advice related to health, finance, or legal matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limitation of liability paragraph clarifies that ForumVerse and its affiliates will not be
      liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. Liability
      is limited to the greater of one hundred dollars or the amount paid for premium services in the
      twelve months preceding the claim. Users agree that this allocation of risk reflects the nature of
      a free platform with optional paid features.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law and Venue</h2>
    <p>
      This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and the United States federal laws
      applicable therein, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. If a dispute proceeds outside of
      arbitration, the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
      located in Wilmington, Delaware. Users waive any objection to venue or inconvenient forum in those
      courts. We reiterate the phrase "governing law" to make detection straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreement clarifies that certain consumer rights may still apply in other jurisdictions and
      that ForumVerse strives to comply with regional privacy regulations. The section also excludes the
      United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Moderation Appeals</h2>
    <p>
      ForumVerse provides an appeals process for moderation actions. Users can request a review by a
      panel of experienced moderators or by the trust and safety team. Persistent violators may lose the
      ability to create new communities, but the platform publishes regular reports summarizing
      enforcement activity. These details supply additional structure for the summarizer.
