My father had passed away, and I also didn\'t know any of my relatives on the mainland and had no way to contact them. In mid-October 2020, I saw that FamilySearch had a new search feature, so I used the tool to first search using my ancestors\' generation characters and then followed the line to find the names of my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. I felt like I was on a kind of treasure hunt. I hadn\'t realized how immense my clan would be\u2014people with the same generation characters filled several volumes\u2014and I had to search patiently page-by-page. After two days of searching, I finally found it. The joy in my heart was indescribable. This is truly a priceless treasure.","Testimonials.content.zhouDeMing":"The Shanghai Library and FamilySearch first started working together at the end of the last century, and our formal partnership collecting, organizing, researching, and providing services related to Chinese clan genealogies (jiapu) has lasted more than 20 years. Clan genealogies document the lineage, individuals, and deeds of an extended family sharing the same ancestral blood line. They are an important part of humanity\'s cultural heritage and are essential tools for genealogy, academic research, and establishing social harmony. This is very consistent with FamilySearch\'s understanding of genealogy.","Testimonials.name.liKangQi":"Lee Khong Kee","Testimonials.name.zhangPeiPei":"Chang Pei-pei","Testimonials.name.zhouDeMing":"Zhou Deming","Testimonials.title.liKangQi":"Program Development Director, Genealogy Society Singapore","Testimonials.title.zhangPeiPei":"FamilySearch user, Taiwan","Testimonials.title.zhouDeMing":"Former Deputy Director, Shanghai Library","add-find-flow.alert.person-created":"Person Successfully Created","add-find-flow.alert.relationship-created":"Relationship Successfully Created","add-find-flow.button.add-child":"Add Child","add-find-flow.button.add-child-unknown-father":"Add Child with an Unknown Father","add-find-flow.button.add-child-unknown-mother":"Add Child with an Unknown Mother","add-find-flow.button.add-father":"Add Father","add-find-flow.button.add-mother":"Add Mother","add-find-flow.button.add-parent":"Add Parent","add-find-flow.button.add-spouse":"Add Spouse","add-find-flow.button.add-person":"Add Person","add-find-flow.button.add-relationship":"Add Relationship","add-find-flow.button.add-first-ancestor":"Add First Ancestor","add-find-flow.button.add-unconnected-person":"Add Unconnected Person","add-find-flow.button.copy-from-my-tree":"From FamilySearch Tree","add-find-flow.button.copy-to-pedigree":"Copy To Pedigree","add-find-flow.button.copy-couple":"Copy Couple","add-find-flow.button.copy-person":"Copy Person","add-find-flow.header.private-people-from-my-tree":"Private People From My Tree","add-find-flow.empty-private-people-list":"There are no private people in your tree.","add-find-flow.button.father":"Father","add-find-flow.button.find-by-id":"By ID Number","add-find-flow.button.find-by-name":"By Name","add-find-flow.button.husband":"Husband","add-find-flow.button.mother":"Mother","add-find-flow.button.refine-search":"Refine Search","add-find-flow.button.remove-additional-find-option.father":"Remove Father","add-find-flow.button.remove-additional-find-option.mother":"Remove Mother","add-find-flow.button.remove-additional-find-option.husband":"Remove Husband","add-find-flow.button.remove-additional-find-option.wife":"Remove Wife","add-find-flow.button.replace":"Replace","add-find-flow.button.wife":"Wife","add-find-flow.create-new.description":"If none of these matches are a correct match, select the Create Person button.","add-find-flow.error.TF_435":"There was an error trying to add this person.
