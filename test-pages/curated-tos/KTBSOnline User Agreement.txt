This Agreement is applicable to all persons who use or access the Platform and/or the Services, in their company’s capacity or in an individual capacity, including authorized users representing the company (each an “Account Administrator”, as further set forth in Section 2), its employees, plan participants and their dependents, and/or other persons using or accessing the Platform and/or the Services (collectively, “Users” and each, a “User”). If User is an Account Administrator and thus agreeing to these terms on behalf of a business or an individual other than User (the “Employer”), User represents and warrants that User has authority to bind that Employer to this Agreement, and User’s agreement to these terms will be treated as the agreement of such Employer. In that event,“User” also refers to that Employer.

By clicking the applicable button to indicate User’s acceptance of this Agreement, or by accessing or using the Platform, User agrees, effective as of the date of such action, to be bound by the Agreement.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.

Please review Section 25 of this Agreement carefully, as it contains an arbitration provision and class action waiver which requires User to resolve disputes with Provider through final, binding arbitration on an individual basis. By entering into this Agreement, User is acknowledging that User has read and that User understands the terms of this Agreement and that User agrees to be bound by the arbitration provision and class action waiver.

1. Platform Overview. Access to the Platform is contingent upon the contracting by the Employer, its agency or representatives (collectively or individually: “Company,” "Customer" or “Employer") with PROVIDER for use of the Platform pursuant to a service agreement between Company and PROVIDER. The Platform is available only to individuals that have a registered username and password (an “Account”) and are employees of the Company indicated on the Platform. Individuals who do not have a valid registered username and password or who are no longer an employee or plan participant of the Employer are not authorized to use or access the Platform.

2. Use of Platform. PROVIDER is making the content and services on the Platform available to User under these terms and conditions (the "Terms"). On the Platform, User may have access to certain features, information, and documents relating to employee benefits, payroll, HR support, onboarding/applicant tracking solutions, and/or other information related to the Services, and to utilize certain Services provided by PROVIDER, its licensors, and/or Third Party Service Providers (as defined below).The Services may permit User to make certain elections through the Platform and to upload and update certain personal information, in each case through the use of certain software proprietary to PROVIDER and/or its licensors or Third Party Service Providers. In performing the Services, PROVIDER will rely on the information furnished by User, User’s Account Administrators, or User’s Authorized Representatives (as hereafter defined) and PROVIDER is not responsible or liable for any errors resulting from such reliance, as further described in this Agreement. User will designate and authorize either itself and/or one or more individuals with authority to (i) act on User’s behalf, (ii) provide information on User’s behalf, and (iii) bind User and/or User’s business (Employer) with respect to the Services (each such individual, an “Account Administrator”). An Account Administrator is authorized by User to access the Platform and/or the Services by entering a confidential username and password. Such Account login information will entitle the Account Administrator, depending on their designation and the permissions given by User, to have the authority to input information and access, review, modify, and/or provide approvals on User’s behalf. If the User agreeing to these Terms is an Account Administrator, then such User is the Company’s authorized contact from whom PROVIDER will take all instructions, unless such other person is designated in writing by the Company to PROVIDER, and neither PROVIDER nor its affiliates or its and their employees will be liable for following such instructions. To help prevent employee fraud, PROVIDER recommends that Company have someone other than Company’s designated contact review Company disbursement reports; a prompt and thorough review allows Company to spot and correct errors and inconsistencies. User therefore agrees to promptly review all records and other reports User receives from PROVIDER for validity and accuracy according to Company’s records. User is solely responsible for all actions taken under any Account that User has access to. Any actions taken under Account(s) that User has access to will be deemed authorized by User, regardless of User’s knowledge of such actions (the “Authorized Actions”). Authorized Actions include, but are not limited to, (i) actions taken by User, an Account Administrator, or an authorized representative of User (an “Authorized Representative”), and (ii) actions that User, an Account Administrator, or an Authorized Representative (or anyone that PROVIDER reasonably believes to be User, an Account Administrator, or an Authorized Representative) directs or instructs PROVIDER to take on its behalf. In addition, User is solely responsible for (i) following instructions that PROVIDER provides to User with respect to the Platform or the Services, whether such instructions are provided via the Platform, email, or otherwise, (ii) obtaining, maintaining, and keeping secure any equipment and ancillary services necessary to connect to, access, or otherwise utilize the Platform, including, but not limited to, internet access, networking equipment, hardware, software, and operating systems, and (iii) maintaining applicable accounts with providers of Third Party Services (as defined below) utilized by User. User is responsible for timely providing PROVIDER with all information including Customer Data (as hereafter defined) required for PROVIDER to perform any of the Services and in an electronic file format specified by and accessible to PROVIDER. User may furnish such information directly to PROVIDER or via an Account Administrator or Authorized Representative. “Customer Data” shall mean any and all information provided to PROVIDER in connection with the Services, including, but not limited to, information provided by User, Account Administrators, Authorized Representatives, User’s employees, or User’s independent contractors, and all information posted in connection with the Service for User’s review on the Platform or otherwise requested for review by PROVIDER, such as the information used to calculate and pay employee payroll, track User’s defined employee benefits, pay payroll taxes to applicable taxing agencies (including User’s employer identification number(s), unemployment insurance tax rates, and employment tax deposit schedule), produce payroll tax returns and W-2 statements, print checks on User’s Bank Account (if applicable), employee/participant information (including, but not limited to, “Personal Data”as set forth in the Privacy Policy), and any other Company information or materials, regardless of form (e.g., images, graphics, text, etc.), related to the Services. Furthermore, User represents and warrants to PROVIDER that for any information that User shares with PROVIDER, whether directly, via its Account Administrator, or via its Authorized Representative, User will have the authority to share such information. User is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of information provided to PROVIDER, and User will ensure that any such information, whether provided by User, an Account Administrator, or Authorized Representative, is accurate and complete. Moreover, User is required to maintain the accuracy and completeness of such information on an ongoing basis and will promptly notify PROVIDER, whether directly or through an Account Administrator or Authorized Representative, of any changes to the information provided to PROVIDER. Upon completion of the initial setup, User will review the Customer Data provided to PROVIDER as part of the initial setup, as such Customer Data is included in the Services. By commencing “live” processing or using the Services, User confirms that all Customer Data is accurate and complete. PROVIDER shall have no liability to Users for any errors or inaccuracies in Customer Data included in the initial setup or in the Services that has been reviewed and approved by User, an Account Administrator, or Authorized Representative.

Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Platform, User acknowledges and agrees as follows:

User agrees that User is authorized to access and use the Platform, and in doing so, agrees to use the Platform only for its lawful and intended purpose, without violating any applicable state or Federal law or regulation, and shall not attempt to obtain access to any portion of the Platform, any computer, server, account, network, software or hardware associated with the Platform, from which User is restricted.
User agrees not to use the Platform for any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement, including, without limitation: impersonating or misrepresenting User’s affiliation with any person or entity; providing, directly or indirectly, any of the Services or any portion thereof, including any contents, information, tools, calculators and resources to any party other than itself and/or Company employees; advertising or soliciting funds or goods and services or soliciting users to join competitive online services. User acknowledges that PROVIDER reserves the right to prohibit any conduct involving the Platform that it deems to be inappropriate.
User agrees not to disrupt the Platform or interfere with or compromise: (a) other visitor's use of the Platform, or (b) the security of the Platform, or any computers, servers, accounts, networks, data, software and/or hardware associated with the Platform;
User acknowledges and agrees that while PROVIDER will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss of or alteration to User’s data files and/or Customer Data in its possession in connection with the Services, including employing regular back-up procedures, PROVIDER does not undertake to guarantee against any such loss or alteration. PROVIDER is not and will not be User’s record keeper. Accordingly, User will, to the extent User deems necessary, keep copies of all source documents of information delivered to PROVIDER in connection with the Services. User acknowledges and agrees that User and/or Company, and not PROVIDER, is solely responsible for maintaining and backing-up any information User and/or Company is providing or using in connection with the Platform or the Services.
User agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the provision of Account login credentials (e.g., username and password) or identity verification credentials to PROVIDER by User, an Account Administrator, or an Authorized Representative, together with any actions authorized by such foregoing parties via the Platform (e.g., clicking the “Submit Payroll” or other buttons) or otherwise (e.g., verbally telling a PROVIDER representative to take an action), will have the same effect as such parties providing a written signature authorizing electronic payments, filings, or any other actions in connection with the Services.
3. User Responsibilities.

Accuracy of Information, Review of Data. User, whether directly or through its Account Administrators or Authorized Representatives, is responsible for: (a) submitting accurate information relating to the Services and verifying the ongoing accuracy and completeness of all such information, and (b) reviewing any reports, filing, information documents or materials posted to the Platform by Provider (or otherwise made available to User by Provider) for User’s review (collectively, the “Materials”), and User must notify PROVIDER of any inaccuracies in the Materials as soon as possible, or within the time period specified in communications received from PROVIDER.. User acknowledges and agrees that the information that User inputs may be used and relied upon as-is by PROVIDER in providing the Services and the Platform. Furthermore, User acknowledges and agrees that it is User’s responsibility to submit instructions and information relating to the Services and to verify the accuracy and completeness of all such instructions and information submitted on behalf of the Company and its employees. PROVIDER does not review the accuracy or completeness of the information User (or User’s Account Administrator or Authorized Representative) submits. Furthermore, User agrees to provide PROVIDER with timely written notice of employee-level changes (i.e., life events) that may impact the Provider’s provision of the Services, including, without limitation, User’s employee benefits. Furthermore, User acknowledges and agrees that User will facilitate the provision of any associated supporting documentation, which may include, without limitation, birth certificates, marriage certificates, Qualified Domestic Relations Orders, and so on. User, and not Provider, shall be solely liable for the failure to timely or accurately provide this information.
Protected Health Information. User agrees that any protected health information (PHI) inputted to the Platform must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, HIPAA Privacy and Security Acts, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and all HIPAA Privacy regulations governing the release of PHI. User agrees to abide by the HIPAA and HITECH regulations and take responsibility for any adverse activity that occurs as a result of materials generated by the Platform. User furthermore agrees to use and maintain all PHI in accordance with HIPAA and HITECH and understands that User (or User’s Employer) is directly responsible under HIPAA for any unsecure disclosure of PHI. In the event of a potential PHI disclosure, User (or User’s Employer) agrees to inform PROVIDER immediately upon becoming aware of the incident. For more information in regard to the HIPAA Privacy Act please refer to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website at https://aspe.hhs.gov/administrative-simplification-privacy-and-security.
Payment Services. If User (or User’s Employer) is receiving any of the Services that require PROVIDER to collect/remit funds from Company’s designated bank account, as designated through the Platform or the Services (the “Bank Account”) to pay User’s third-party payment obligations (e.g., payroll, benefit premiums, workers’ compensation, etc.) User shall have sufficient funds in the Bank Account within the deadline established by PROVIDER to satisfy such third-party payment obligations together with PROVIDER’s fees for Services, in their entirety. User further acknowledges that any benefit premium payments are ultimately User’s (or User’s Employer’s) responsibility and any audit adjustments and/or payments are User’s (or User’s Employer’s) sole responsibility. PROVIDER shall not be responsible for paying benefit premiums or other payment obligations on User’s behalf. User acknowledges and agrees that PROVIDER may commingle collected funds, including, but not limited to, insurance premiums, with other clients’ funds of a similar type. Furthermore, User acknowledges and agrees that PROVIDER may utilize an interest bearing or income producing holding account for all Company funds collected and that all amounts earned on such funds while held by PROVIDER will be for the sole account of PROVIDER.
Provider Notification. User, whether directly or through its Account Administrators or Authorized Representatives, is obligated to promptly notify PROVIDER of any third-party notices that User may receive which could affect PROVIDER’s ability to effectively provide the Services or increase the likelihood that a Claim (as defined below) is brought against User or PROVIDER in connection with the Services, such as notices from the Internal Revenue Service or other government agencies regarding penalties or errors relating to the Payroll Services (as defined below), and, if User receives the Benefits Service (as defined below), notices from insurance carriers regarding eligibility, enrollment, payment, or any other communications affecting the contract of services with that insurance carrier.
4. Benefits Service (In General). Subject to the terms and conditions of an applicable service agreement between PROVIDER and Company for the provision of benefit plan services (the “Benefits Service”), if Employer has elected to receive the Benefits Service, PROVIDER agrees to use reasonable efforts to provide User with the Benefits Service in accordance with the terms of said service agreement between PROVIDER and Company. If User (or User’s Employer) is receiving the Benefits Service, PROVIDER may make recommendations and price estimations based on the Employer’s location, group size, and specific circumstances. As a part of the Benefits Service, PROVIDER or its agents may provide oral or written summaries and descriptions of insurance plans (“Benefits Guidance”). In the event that there is a conflict between the Benefits Guidance and any information contained in insurance plan documents or the insurance carrier certificates published by the insurance carrier, the information contained in the insurance plan documents or certificates shall control. PROVIDER is not an insurance company or carrier. As such, it does not and cannot design, amend, modify, or terminate the insurance plans offered or recommended as part of the Benefits Service. Additionally, PROVIDER does not process claims, make decisions, or determine eligibility requirements for specific insurance plans. User acknowledges that the Employer, as Plan Sponsor, remains the fiduciary of any and all insurance plans procured or managed through the Benefits Service. User shall be responsible for reviewing for accuracy all communications, notices, and invoices User receives. User shall be responsible for promptly notifying PROVIDER of any errors or omissions so that PROVIDER may rectify any such errors or omissions. User (or User’s Employer) shall be responsible for any fees it incurs as a result of its failure to review said notices and timely report such errors to PROVIDER. User further acknowledges that it is responsible for notifying PROVIDER of any and all qualifying events that may impact User’s health insurance eligibility. Failure to timely notify PROVIDER or the insurance carrier may result in delays in, termination of, or inability to obtain health insurance coverage, and any costs, penalties, or taxes that incur as a result.

Insurance Carrier Applications and Paperwork. User will be responsible for reviewing all applications and paperwork required to be submitted to insurance carriers and will promptly notify PROVIDER of any incorrect information included in such applications and paperwork. PROVIDER will not be responsible for any incorrect information included in such applications and/or paperwork. PROVIDER may assist User with the completion of said paperwork but it is User’s responsibility to accurately complete. User acknowledges that insurance carriers may reject or rescind an insurance plan, in their sole discretion, if the insurance carrier suspects fraud or subsequently discovers materials facts not disclosed to PROVIDER or the insurance carrier at the time of the insurance plan selection.
Notifications of Policy Change or Termination. If User wishes to request a policy change, change payment terms and/or terminate the insurance policy and desires PROVIDER to assist User in facilitating these changes with the insurance carrier, User will provide PROVIDER with a formal written notice of such request. If User fails to provide PROVIDER with a formal written notice of such request, the insurance carrier may decline to process the request and, in certain cases, could cancel the User’s and/or Employer’s coverage. All such notices shall be provided to PROVIDER via Certified Mail to the address as set forth in the Notices section of this Agreement, or such other address as PROVIDER may provide to User and/or Employer in writing.
COBRA and State Continuation Coverage Administration. Certain employee Users who have terminated employment with an employer that remains an active User of PROVIDER’S COBRA/State Continuation Full Administration Service (“Former Employee”) and who wish to enroll in health insurance pursuant to COBRA or state continuation coverage, may do so using PROVIDER. Former Employees can utilize the Benefits Services to enroll in COBRA or state continuation coverage. While a Former Employee may continue to access its account on the Platform, PROVIDER does not guarantee that the Platform will be updated to reflect Former Employee’s COBRA or state continuation coverage enrollment information.
Selection of Insurance Carrier. To the extent Benefits Services are provided, PROVIDER is a third party administrator providing such services to assist in the collection and processing of enrollment data and/or the collection of premiums on behalf of the insurance carrier from which coverage has been requested by the Employer. User acknowledges that PROVIDER has and/or may assist with obtaining coverage and/or benefits from insurance carriers and may receive compensation from the insurance carriers for placing policies with the insurance carriers. PROVIDER works with a limited number of insurance carriers and may not obtain quotes from all available insurance carriers. The selection of an insurance carrier is the sole decision of the Employer and participating employees and PROVIDER does not guarantee the financial stability or performance of any such carriers. PROVIDER has no underwriting or claims paying functions. PROVIDER has no authority to underwrite or bind coverage. All decisions as to requests for additional information used to make decisions whether to bind coverage, the binding of coverage, the level of coverage provided, or the payment or denial of claims are made solely by the insurance carrier. PROVIDER has no role in making these decisions. Any coverage bound is a contract between the participating employee, the Employer and the insurance carrier. PROVIDER is not a party to that contract. Benefits are subject to the contractual terms, limitations and exclusions as set forth in the master contract. The insurance carrier from which the participating employee has requested coverage will rely on the information provided during the enrollment process. PROVIDER will transmit the data as provided by the User of the Platform to the insurance carrier. PROVIDER is not responsible for any determinations made based on the information provided by the User during enrollment or in response to any subsequent inquiry by the insurance carrier. The insurance carrier may require additional information, forms and/or documents, amongst other potential items [such as Evidence of Insurability (EOI)], from the participating employee and/or any other person for which the participating employee is requesting coverage prior to making a decision as to what, if any, coverage the insurance carrier will provide. Following directions from the insurance carrier and providing the requested information in a timely manner is of critical importance. The administration of benefits by PROVIDER does not guarantee coverage. The deduction of premiums from the participating employee's pay does not in and of itself guarantee that any coverage, or coverage at the levels requested, has been bound and is in effect. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF SECTION 26 OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (I) NOTHING HEREIN CONSTITUTES AN OFFER OR GUARANTEE OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE; (II) REQUIREMENTS FOR A SPECIFIC INSURANCE PLAN OR SERVICE ARE MADE SOLELY BY THE BENEFITS PROVIDER OF THAT INSURANCE PLAN OR SERVICE; AND (III) PROVIDER DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY BENEFITS PROVIDER’S INSURANCE PLAN OR SERVICE. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
5. Payroll Service (In General). Subject to the terms and conditions of an applicable payroll service agreement between PROVIDER and Company, if Employer has elected to receive services under said service agreement, PROVIDER agrees to use reasonable efforts to provide User with the payroll service(s) in accordance with said agreement (the “Payroll Service”). If User is receiving the Payroll Service from PROVIDER, the information User provides to PROVIDER must be accurate and complete, otherwise the tax calculations or any reports may be inaccurate, and the Payroll Services may not perform accurately. User is solely responsible for the data that User enters, including, without limitation, accurate social security numbers, spelling of names, any current Employer Identification Numbers, the hours User inputs for work performed by User or User’s employees including overtime, and any other data PROVIDER requires from User. It is User’s (or User’s Employer’s) responsibility to verify that all paychecks, paystubs and calculations are accurate during the review process before User (or User’s Employer) approves a payroll. User acknowledges and agrees that the Employer is solely responsible for obtaining signed and completed IRS Form W-4, also known as the Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, from each employee to the extent required by law. Employers are required to compute withholding based on the information from the employee's most recently furnished Form W-4. PROVIDER will not be liable for any penalty, interest or other liability that results from inaccurate or incomplete information User supplies or from failure to obtain completed and signed Form W-4s as required by law. THE PAYROLL SERVICE WILL HELP USER FILE AND MAKE PAYMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. HOWEVER, IT IS EMPLOYER’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE ACTION IN A TAX COMPLIANT MANNER WITH THE DUTIES OF AN EMPLOYER. For more information, please reference the IRS Publication 926, as well as applicable state tax laws for employers. In form 926, the IRS states “Outsourcing payroll duties. Generally, as an employer, you are responsible to ensure that tax returns are filed and deposits and payments are made, even if your contract with a third party to perform these acts. You remain responsible if the third party fails to perform any required action. Before you choose to outsource any of your payroll and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a third-party payer, such as a payroll service provider or reporting agent, go to https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/outsourcing-payroll-duties for helpful information on this topic. For more information on the different types of third-party payer arrangements, see section 16 in Pub. 15. It is your responsibility to keep any payroll, tax or other records User may need for reference, even though we may have information about the records and payments in our files.”

User Acknowledgements. In performing the Payroll Service, User acknowledges and agrees that (i) PROVIDER is not acting in a fiduciary capacity for User and/or User’s Employer; (ii) using the Payroll Service does not relieve User (or User’s Employer) its obligations under local, state, or federal laws or regulations to retain records relating to Customer Data contained in PROVIDER’s files; (iii) any information that PROVIDER provides in connection with the Payroll Service is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice; and (iv) PROVIDER is not responsible for determining whether the bank accounts of any payors or payees have deposit or withdrawal restrictions.
Direct Deposit Services. With respect to Direct Deposit Services, prior to the first credit to the account of any employee or other individual (a“Payee”), User (or User’s Employer) shall obtain a signed authorization from such Payee (a “Payee Authorization”), which shall be in a form required by NACHA to include but not be limited to the authorization of Payee reversals. User (or User’s Employer) shall retain a copy of each Payee Authorization during the period such Payee Authorization is in effect and for two years thereafter and shall furnish such copy to PROVIDER upon request. User (or User’s Employer) represents and warrants to PROVIDER and to the bank originating debit/credit instructions on PROVIDER’s behalf (the “Originating Bank”), if applicable, that (a) each credit and debit (reversing or correcting a prior payroll credit) to the account of a Payee is timely and has been authorized pursuant to a Payee Authorization signed by such Payee and held by Employer; (b) at the time any credit is made to the account of any such Payee, User (or User’s Employer) has no actual knowledge of the revocation or termination of such Payee’s Payee Authorization; (c) each debit to the account of a Payee (reversing or correcting prior payroll credit) is for a sum which is due and owing to User (or User’s Employer) and User (or User’s Employer) has notified the Payee of such debit prior to its initiation; and (d) the amount indicated by User (or User’s Employer) as being owned to each Payee is in fact due and owing to such Payee.
Failed Direct Deposits. In the event that a direct deposit payroll payment fails to be paid to the Payee and PROVIDER cannot ultimately successfully make a payment on User's behalf to the Payee, and the funds are returned to PROVIDER (“Unpaid Funds”), PROVIDER will notify User of such Unpaid Funds and provide User with the appropriate details related to those funds. Provider will return the Unpaid Funds to User in accordance with its general payroll practices. User, not PROVIDER, is required to contact payees and/or otherwise resolve the Unpaid Funds. User acknowledges that User is responsible for complying with all applicable state unclaimed or abandoned property laws related to Unpaid Funds, and User hereby expressly releases PROVIDER from all liability and Claims directly or indirectly arising from state unclaimed or abandoned property laws, including any applicable penalties and/or interest. PROVIDER shall have no obligation to defend or otherwise indemnify User in the event of an audit, examination, assessment, or other enforcement action by a state related to the Unpaid Funds under its unclaimed or abandoned property laws.
6. Privacy Policies. PROVIDER respects the privacy of its customers and its Users of the Platform. Any personally identifiable information about a User that is provided by such User or the User’s Employer through the Platform and is accessible by PROVIDER (“Personal Data”) is subject to applicable Privacy Policies, available for review on the Sites, and which may be amended from time to time. By using the Services, User acknowledges that User has reviewed the applicable Privacy Policies (including, without limitation, the Biometric Information Privacy Policy, where applicable) and accepts and agrees to the terms of such Privacy Policies, including changes published by PROVIDER, and that PROVIDER may use and maintain User’s Personal Data according to applicable Privacy Policies and the Terms of this Agreement.

7. License for Customer Data. User grants PROVIDER a license to process, transmit, use and store Customer Data as reasonably required to provide the Services. Subject to the limited rights granted by User hereunder, PROVIDER acquires no right title or interest from User under this Agreement to Customer Data, including any intellectual property rights therein. PROVIDER will, however, have the permanent right to aggregate and use, for any lawful purpose, the data generated by User’s use of the Platform and/or the Services, so long as such data to be aggregated or used does not personally identify the User. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

8. Access and Disclosure of Customer Data. PROVIDER will not disclose Customer Data to a third party unless required by law, requested by User or User’s Account Administrator or Authorized Representative, or authorized in writing by a User or its Employer, except to share with a PROVIDER affiliate or strategic business partner, Third Party Service Provider or licensor, or in connection with providing Services or support and maintenance to User or the Employer. PROVIDER will require its employees, contractors and agents having access to such Customer Data to act in accordance with the obligations in this section. PROVIDER will take commercially reasonable efforts to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such personally identifiable information collected and stored by PROVIDER and PROVIDER employees. User acknowledges and agrees that (i) Users are solely responsible for the form, content and accuracy of any Customer Data, (ii) PROVIDER is not responsible for monitoring Customer Data stored on the Platform, (iii) PROVIDER is not responsible for User’s detrimental reliance on any Customer Data manipulated by any third party, including, without limitation, a Third Party Service Provider, (iv) PROVIDER does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any Customer Data, and (v) PROVIDER makes no warranty of any kind with regard to the integrity or reliability of any Customer Data. In the event of any loss or damage to User’s Customer Data by PROVIDER, Users’ sole remedy will be for PROVIDER to use commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore the lost or damaged Customer Data from the latest back-up of such Customer Data. Further, if User or User’s employees provide personally identifiable information to PROVIDER from data subjects in Canada or the European Union ("EU"), then User (i) consents to, acknowledges, and agrees that in connection with any Services offered, PROVIDER or Third Party Service Provider may transfer, access, store, and process such personally identifiable information outside of the EU and Canada in the United States, which under EU and Canadian laws may not ensure an adequate level of data protection (the "Customer Data Transfer"); (ii) consent to such Customer Data Transfer, and (iii) will ensure compliance with all applicable EU and Canadian laws that apply to User/User’s employees as the data controller of such personally identifiable information in connection with the Customer Data transfer. Furthermore, User acknowledges that some Third Party Service Providers (as defined below) selected by User or User’s Employer (e.g., retirement plan recordkeepers) may store data outside of the United States, and User hereby consents to PROVIDER’s transmission of Shared Information cross-borders for purposes of User receiving the Services and/or Third Party Service. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

9. Transmissions of Data. Data transmitted to and from the Platform is encrypted for the Users’ protection. However, the security of information transmitted through the Internet can never be guaranteed. User acknowledges that transmissions to and from the Platform could be read or intercepted by others. PROVIDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERCEPTION OR INTERRUPTION OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR FOR CHANGES TO OR LOSSES OF DATA. AS SUCH, USER AGREES THAT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION INPUTTED INTO THE PLATFORM BY USER OR USER’S EMPLOYEES IS DONE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVE AT USER’S AND USER’S EMPLOYEES’ RISK. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

10. Communications. Except for personally identifiable information collected under the guidelines established in the PROVIDER’S Privacy Policy, User agrees that all submissions, comments, or inquiries made by User or on User’s behalf, (collectively, "Communications") will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. PROVIDER will have no obligations with respect to the Communications. By submitting Communications to PROVIDER on or through the Platform, User irrevocably transfers to PROVIDER, and forever waives and agrees never to assert, any copyrights or other rights that User may have in such Communications. PROVIDER, its affiliates, Third Party Service Providers, and/or licensors, will be free to use, disclose, incorporate and otherwise use or destroy the Communications and other text or graphics embodied in the Communications for any and all commercial or noncommercial purposes. PROVIDER is and shall be under no obligation to respond to any Communications.

11. Electronic Signature Consent. User agrees to PROVIDER’s electronic signature consent when presented, including any federal, state or local powers of attorney, authorization to obtain a federal employer identification number and/or a state tax ID number if needed, to receive notices electronically and aid the payment of taxes due on User’s behalf. Furthermore, as a condition of using the Platform, User hereby requests and authorizes that User’s electronic signature act as User’s legal signature for all Internet-based transactions between User, User’s employees, PROVIDER and any and all vendors contracted to provide services, coverage and/or benefits to User and/or User’s employees, including, without limitation, Third Party Service Providers (as defined below). User’s electronic signature will consist of User’s username and a unique identifier password (or other user identification as may be approved by PROVIDER) that are inputted in order to use the Platform. User agrees that User’s electronic signature affixed to or contained in any data related to an Internet-based transaction conducted through the Platform shall be sufficient to verify that User (and for Account Administrators, the Company) properly authorized such transaction and the dissemination of information in connection therewith. User agrees that this Agreement, agreements ancillary to this Agreement and related documents to be entered into in connection with this Agreement will be considered signed when User’s electronic signature is transmitted with such electronic documents. Such signature shall be treated in all respects as having the same effect as an original handwritten signature.

12. Electronic Forms Consent. User consents to PROVIDER furnishing User with electronic delivery of tax forms, whether through email, text, push notification or delivered through the Platform itself, including W2s for User and/or User’s employees. If a User refuses to receive a W2 electronically, User should contact its payroll representative in writing.

13. Electronic Disclosures, Notices, and Updates. PROVIDER may provide disclosures, updates and notices required by law and other information about the Services, the Platform or User’s Account to User electronically, by posting it on the Platform, texting to User’s phone number listed in User’s Account, pushing notifications through the Platform, or by emailing it to the email address listed in User’s Account. Electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if PROVIDER had provided User with paper copies. Such disclosures and notices are considered received by User within twenty-four (24) hours of the time posted to the Platform, or within twenty-four (24) hours of the time electronically transmitted to User unless PROVIDER receives notice that the electronic transmission was not delivered. If User wishes to withdraw User’s consent, User may need to terminate User’s Account. User gives PROVIDER permission to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies the individual who opens an Account or accesses the Service or the Platform. PROVIDER may ask for User’s name, address, date of birth, Employer Identification Number and/or State Employer Identification Number for Employers, social security numbers and other information that will allow PROVIDER to identify User for the purposes of the Services. User consents to and authorizes PROVIDER at any time to verify social security numbers, and to report adverse credit information about User, to others, including the Internal Revenue Service and any applicable state taxing authorities. User also hereby represents, understands and expressly agrees that PROVIDER does not have control over or assumes any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included during any verification process. PROVIDER will not communicate the results to any third party, though PROVIDER reserves the right to do so for law enforcement or other safety-related purposes.

If User is receiving the Benefit Services, Federal law requires that certain disclosures be provided to User about User’s selection of, or enrollment in, the employee benefits referenced on the Platform, which are as follows:

Some or all of the online employee benefits enrollment, election or waiver materials on the Platform (collectively, "enrollment materials") will be made available to User in electronic format.
User has the right to receive some or all of the enrollment materials in paper format. The enrollment materials can be provided to User in paper format at no cost if User contacts the Employer’s employee benefits manager in writing and specify the document or documents that User wishes to receive in paper format.
User has the right to withdraw User’s consent to receive records electronically at any time. In order to withdraw consent, User’s request must be sent to the Employer’s employee benefits manager in writing.
User’s consent applies to all employee benefit enrollment or election materials and all other information or documents related to either (1) enrollment or participation in the User’s benefits offered by Employer, (2) any change or modification of the terms of enrollment or (3) a termination, in whole or in part, of participation in any employee benefit described herein. To ensure that User can be provided with notices and information from time to time, User, or Account Administrator, or an Authorized Representative must promptly update PROVIDER with any change in User’s email address.
PROVIDER may share User’s email addresses with insurance providers that User, Account Administrator, or an Authorized Representative selects. The insurance providers may choose to communicate with User through electronic email notices instead of paper notices. These notifications will include, but are not limited to, Explanation of Benefits (EOB) alerts, appeal decision alerts, and Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices. User may also receive information on programs related to existing products and services along with new products and services that may be of interest to User. User can request for a paper copy of electronic notices or opt out of receiving electronic email notices at any time by calling the insurance provider’s customer service phone number.
14. E-SIGN Service. For Users that have elected to receive certain features under the Payroll Service, PROVIDER offers an electronic signature service (the“E-Sign Service”) which allows the Employer to upload documents to a User’s account for the User to sign electronically. Each time that User uses the E-Sign Service, User is expressly (i) affirming that User is able to access and view the document User is electronically signing (the “Document”) via the E-Sign Service; (ii) consenting to conduct business electronically with respect to the transaction contemplated by the Document; and (iii) agreeing to the use of electronic signatures for the Document. While many individuals prefer the convenience of electronic signatures, using the E-Sign Service to electronically sign Documents is optional and at the Employer’s discretion, and, if Employer so facilitates, User can choose to manually sign Documents if User prefers. If User would like to manually sign a Document, User should (i) inform the Employer’s representative that sent User the Document of User’s decision to manually sign such Document; (ii) make sure that User does not electronically sign the Document via the E-Sign Service; and (iii) obtain a physical copy of the Document for User to sign. Obtaining a physical, non-electronic copy of the Document is User’s sole responsibility, and PROVIDER has no responsibility or liability with respect to such matter. PROVIDER has no responsibility or liability with respect to the content, validity, or enforceability of any Document, nor is it responsible or liable for any matters or disputes arising from the Documents. PROVIDER makes no representations or warranties regarding the validity or enforceability of electronic documents or electronic signatures via the E-Sign Service. UNDER APPLICABLE U.S. STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE ON SOME DOCUMENTS. IT IS USER’S (OR USER’S EMPLOYER’S) RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DOCUMENT WILL BE ENFORCEABLE IF IT IS ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED VIA THE E-SIGN SERVICE.

15. Property Rights. PROVIDER and its licensors and Third Party Service Providers retain all right, title and interest, including, without limitation, all software provided by PROVIDER or its licensors or Third Party Service Providers for User’s use in connection with the Platform, copyrights, trade secrets, patents, trademarks and all other property rights, in and to the Platform, its content and materials related thereto (hereinafter, collectively "Content"), other than personal information provided by User (or User’ Authorized Representative or Account Administrator) as provided in this Agreement. When using Content as permitted in this Agreement, User agrees to comply with the terms of all notices, including, but not limited to, trademark and copyright notices, information and restriction contained in, or accompanying, any Content.

User’s use of Content must also comply with the terms of use and policies of vendors, licensors, or Third Party Service Providers who contribute Content. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by PROVIDER or PROVIDER’S vendors, licensors, or Third Party Service Providers. The Platform is for User’s noncommercial use only. User may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, text, software, or products or services obtained from PROVIDER unless expressly permitted herein. Product and company names mentioned in the Platform may be the protected trademarks of their respective owners and User may not use them without prior written authorization. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

16. Access to and Use of the Platform. In order to access the Platform, User must have a computer with Internet access capabilities. The Minimum System Requirements are as follows: SSL (Secure Socket Layer) compatible browser, such as current versions of Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox, or higher; current versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader. PROVIDER does not guarantee that use of the Platform will be continuous, uninterrupted, or error-free. User acknowledges and agrees that access to the Platform may be unavailable from time to time through no fault of PROVIDER, including, without limitation, downtime due to regular maintenance performed by PROVIDER, its licensors, or its Third Party Service Providers, or its and their respective service providers, and that PROVIDER, its licensors, or its Third Party Service Providers shall not be liable for any damages or losses caused by such unavailability. User will, and will cause authorized users of User’s Account, including but not limited to Account Administrators and Authorized Representatives, to take reasonable steps to adequately secure, and keep confidential, any User Account passwords or credentials, and any information accessible via the User Account. User agrees to immediately notify PROVIDER if User becomes aware of: (a) any loss or theft of any User Password or other Account credentials, (b) any unauthorized use of User Password or other Account credentials, or (c) any indication that inaccurate, conflicting or inappropriate information regarding User, User’s employees, and/or User’s employees’ dependent(s) has been entered into the Platform. PROVIDER reserves the right to prevent access to the Platform if PROVIDER has reason to believe that User’s Account has been compromised. User acknowledges that the Platform acts only as a passive conduit for the online display of information as provided by the User. User agrees to provide to PROVIDER information required to contact User electronically and to promptly update such information within the Platform if this information should change. User acknowledges that PROVIDER grants User a personal, nontransferable and nonexclusive right and license to use the object code of its Content provided that User does not (and does not allow any third party to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Content. User agrees not to access the Platform by any means other than through the interface that is provided by PROVIDER for use in accessing the Platform. Furthermore, User acknowledges that User’s use of certain third-party programs, including, without limitation, Third Party Services, in conjunction with the Platform will be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable third party license agreements. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

17. Consent to Receive SMS/MMS Messages About User’s Account. By providing User’s mobile phone number to PROVIDER, User agrees that PROVIDER may send User autodialed Short Message Service (“SMS”) or Multimedia Messaging Service (“MMS”) messages about activity in User’s Account and service updates, reminder notifications from User’s employer, as well as SMS or MMS messages soliciting User’s feedback about the Services and User’s experience interacting with PROVIDER’S Customer Care team. Standard message and data rates may apply. Note that PROVIDER will not send User autodialed marketing SMS or MMS messages unless User expressly agrees in writing to receive such messages. If User would like to opt out of receiving SMS and MMS messages, User should contact its customer service representative.

18. The Role of PROVIDER. User acknowledges and understands that PROVIDER is merely making the Platform available to User on the Employer’s behalf and that PROVIDER is not acting as an investment advisor, broker-dealer, or intermediary or a financial or benefit planner. PROVIDER is not providing any benefits. The Employer is responsible for making available all benefits and information related thereto referenced or included on the Platform. PROVIDER is not the Employer, plan sponsor, insurance carrier, plan administrator or plan fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) for any benefits or insurance coverage offered through or described in the Platform or the Services. PROVIDER is not responsible for state and Federal disclosure and reporting requests or for complying with existing laws. These responsibilities remain with the Employer.

19. PROVIDER Does Not Give Professional Advice. PROVIDER is not in the business of providing legal, financial, accounting, tax, health care, real estate or other professional services or advice. Users should consult the services of a competent professional when this type of assistance is needed.

20. Third Party Services. Through the Platform, User may be able to elect to receive services from third party service providers whose services integrate with and/or compliment Provider’s Services (each such service, a “Third Party Service,” and each such provider, a “Third Party Service Provider”). User is solely responsible for, and assumes all risk arising from, User’s election to receive and User’s receipt of any Third Party Service. PROVIDER is not responsible for Third Party Services or any material, information, or results made available through Third Party Services. The applicable Third Party Service Provider may require User to agree to terms and conditions or agreements with respect to their provision of the Third Party Services to User. If User elects to receive a Third Party Service, User authorizes PROVIDER to submit and/or transfer to the applicable Third Party Service Provider any and all applicable documents and Customer Data about User, User’s business and User’s business’ employees that are necessary for such Third Party Service Provider to provide the Third Party Service to User, including, without limitation, Customer Data, User’s payroll information, bank account information, User’s employees’ bank account information, retirement plan information, and any additional information, such as the personal information of User’s employees, reasonably requested by such Third Party Service Provider that User has provided to PROVIDER in connection with this Agreement and User’s receipt of the Services (collectively, the “Shared Information”). User is responsible for the accuracy of all Shared Information. User acknowledges that some Third Party Service Providers selected by User or User’s Employer (e.g., retirement plan recordkeepers) may store data outside of the United States, and User hereby consents to PROVIDER’s transmission of Shared Information cross-borders for purposes of User receiving the Third Party Service. User represents and warrants that User has all the rights in and to any Shared Information necessary to provide Shared Information to PROVIDER and for PROVIDER to provide to applicable Third Party Service Providers, and that PROVIDER’s use or disclosure of Shared Information as contemplated hereunder will not violate any rights of privacy or other proprietary rights, or any applicable local, state, or federal laws, regulations, orders, or rules. User agrees that by electing to receive a Third Party Service, and by consenting and authorizing PROVIDER to submit User’s Shared Information to a Third Party Service Provider, User has waived and released any Claim against PROVIDER and its directors, officers, and employees arising out of a Third Party Service Provider’s use of Shared Information, even if that use is not authorized by the applicable agreement between User and the Third Party Service Provider.

21. External Links. The Platform and the Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources which includes software licensors of PROVIDER for which PROVIDER is a re-seller or licensee and are accessible from the Platform via a single sign-on feature (the "External Websites"). PROVIDER provides these External Websites only as a convenience and is not responsible for the availability, content, products, or services on or available from those or resources, or links displayed on such External Links, and PROVIDER does not adopt, endorse, or verify any statements or services on the External Websites. User acknowledges its sole responsibility for, and assumes all risk arising from, User’s use of any External Websites or resources.To the extent that any of the External Websites contain links or a single sign-on to third party services and resources, the availability and content of which PROVIDER does not control, any concerns regarding any such service or resource, or any link thereto, should be directed to the particular outside service or resource. User’s use of products or services made available on External Websites is at User’s own risk, and User agrees to hold PROVIDER harmless for any damages that may occur from User’s or User’s employees’ use of the services made available on such External Websites. Furthermore, PROVIDER does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any content posted on or distributed through External Websites, including, without limitation, the medical library provided through WebMD, company news, and/or any interactive calculators, and User acknowledges that any reliance upon such content shall be at User’s sole risk. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

22. Modification. PROVIDER may modify this Agreement at any time, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting to the Platform. User is responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement to ensure that User is aware of any modifications. User’s continued access or use of the Platform shall be deemed User’s conclusive acceptance of the modified agreement. The parties also agree to take such action as is necessary to amend this Agreement from time to time as is necessary to comply with applicable laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA requirements. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

23. Indemnification. As a condition of using the Platform, User will indemnify and hold harmless PROVIDER and its officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, judgements, penalties, fines, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees) (collectively, the “Claims”), arising out of or in any way connected with (i) User’s access to or use of the Platform, Services, or Content; (ii) User Content; (iii) User’s violation or alleged violation of this Agreement; (iv) User’s violation or alleged violation of any third party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or publicity, or any right provided by any labor or employment law, rule, or regulation, or any intellectual property right; (v) User’s violation or alleged violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, including but not limited to wage and hour laws; (vi) User’s violation of the NACHA Rules; (vii) User’s gross negligence, fraudulent activity, or willful misconduct; (viii) Indemnified Party’s or any Third Party Service Provider’s use of or reliance on information or data furnished by User, an employee or independent contractor of User, User’s Account Administrator, or User’s Authorized Representative in providing the Services, or otherwise in connection with this Agreement; (ix) actions or activities that Indemnified Party or any Third Party Service Provider undertakes in connection with the Services or this Agreement at the direct request or instruction of anyone that PROVIDER or any other Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be User, an Account Administrator, or an Authorized Representative (each such action or activity, a “Requested Action”); (x) Indemnified Party’s or any Third Party Service Provider’s use of or reliance on information or data resulting from such Requested Actions; or (xi) User’s failure, or the failure of any Account Administrators or Authorized Representatives, to properly follow PROVIDER’s instructions with respect to the Services.

24. Term and Termination. The terms and conditions of this Agreement will take effect upon execution (when User checks the box indicating that reads "I have read and accept the terms of the Online User Agreement"). PROVIDER reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate User’s access to all or any part of the Platform, at any time for any reason without prior notice or liability. PROVIDER may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of the Platform at any time, including the availability of any feature, database or Content, without prior notice or liability. User agrees that PROVIDER will not be liable to User, User’s employees, or to any third party for any unavailability, modification, suspension, or termination of any of the Platform, the Content, the Services, the Communications, the Customer Data, or any features or parts thereof.

25. Alternative Dispute Resolution. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, and except as otherwise set forth in this section, if either User or PROVIDER has any dispute, controversy, or claim, whether founded in contract, tort, statutory, or common law, concerning, arising out of, or relating to this Agreement, the Platform, or the Services, including any claim regarding the applicability, interpretation, scope, or validity of this arbitration clause and/or this Agreement (each of the foregoing, a “Legal Claim”) that cannot be resolved directly between User and PROVIDER, then such Legal Claim will be settled by individual (not class or class-wide), confidential, binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the AAA (the “AAA Rules”), including any expedited procedures. To initiate an arbitration proceeding, an arbitration claim must be submitted by the claimant (the“Claimant”) to the AAA, and a written Demand for Arbitration must be provided to the other party (the “Opposing Party”), pursuant to the AAA Rules. Arbitration hearings will be held in Baltimore County, Maryland. A single arbitrator will be mutually selected by PROVIDER and User and shall be (i) a practicing attorney licensed to practice law in Maryland or a retired judge; and (ii) selected from the arbitrators on the AAA’s roster of commercial dispute arbitrators who have a background in payroll, health insurance, human resources, and/or online commerce law (or if there are no such arbitrators, then from the arbitrators on the AAA’s roster of commercial dispute arbitrators) (collectively, the “Arbitrator Requirements”). If PROVIDER and User cannot mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) days of the Opposing Party’s receipt of the Demand for Arbitration from the Claimant, then the AAA shall appoint a single arbitrator that satisfies the Arbitrator Requirements. The arbitrator will follow the law and will give effect to any applicable statutes of limitation and/or any limitation on claims by Employer as provided for in an applicable PROVIDER service agreement. The arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees and costs to the prevailing party. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon User and PROVIDER. A judgment on the award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. PROVIDER may, in its sole discretion, commence an action in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction within the City or County of Baltimore, Maryland, for any monetary amounts that User owes to PROVIDER (each, an “Action”). User hereby waives any objection to jurisdiction or venue, or any defense claiming lack of jurisdiction or improper venue, in any Action brought by PROVIDER in such courts. User and PROVIDER agree and acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code) shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the arbitration clause in this Agreement. USER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES, UNDERSTANDS, AND AGREES THAT USER AND PROVIDER ARE EACH WAIVING THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY AS TO DISPUTES HEREUNDER AND THAT USER IS WAIVING ITS RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT.

PROVIDERS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO USER ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

27. HIPAA Privacy & Security. This section is intended to comply with the requirements of the business associate agreements (if any and if applicable) PROVIDER has entered into with insurers subject to HIPAA and is to be constructed to achieve compliance with those requirements. PROVIDER is contractually prohibited from sharing Protected Health Information (PHI) with User without User’s agreement to comply with the terms of this section. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined in this section, shall have the same meanings as those terms in the Standards for the Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), as modified, codified at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164. "Protected Health Information" or "PHI," as used in this Agreement, means (subject to definition provided at 45 C.F.R. 160.103) individually identifiable health information that User receives from PROVIDER or that User creates or receives on behalf of PROVIDER in connection with this Agreement.
User may use or disclose PHI only for the purposes of fulfilling User’s obligations under agreements with PROVIDER's affiliated carriers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, User may not use or further disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. User may use and disclose PHI for User’s (or User’s Employer’s) proper management and administration or to carry out User’s (or User’s Employer’s) legal responsibilities consistent with the provisions of 45 C.F.R 164.504(e)(4)(i) and (ii). User may only disclose PHI for such purposes if: (a) the disclosure is required by law; or (b) User (or User’s Employer) obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the information is disclosed that it will remain confidential and be used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies User (or User’s Employer) of any instances of which he or she is aware in which the confidentiality of the information was breached.
User will not use or further disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by this Agreement or as required by law.
User will ensure that any agent of User’s (or User’s Employer), including a subcontractor of User (or of User’s Employer), to whom User (or User’s Employer) provides PHI received from or created or received by User or User (or User’s Employer) on behalf of PROVIDER, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to User with respect to such information.
In accordance with 45 C.F.R. 164.520, and to the extent that such a limitation may affect User’s (or User’s Employer’s) use or disclosure of PHI, PROVIDER will notify User (or User’s Employer) of any limitation(s) and changes in, or revocation of, permission by an individual to use or disclose PHI.
User will use appropriate safeguards to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI. User will implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the electronic PHI that User (or User’s Employer) creates, receives, maintains or transmits to or on behalf of PROVIDER as required by the HIPAA Security Standard, as amended from time to time. User (or User’s Employer) will report to PROVIDER any security incident of which User becomes aware.
User agrees to mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect that is known to User of a use or disclosure of PHI by User in violation of the requirements of this Section.
User (or User’s Employer) will report to PROVIDER any use or disclosure of PHI not provided for by this Section of which User become aware.
User will make PHI and information related to disclosures of PHI by User available to PROVIDER in the time, manner and place designated by PROVIDER, to the extent required to provide an accounting of disclosures in accordance with 45 C.F.R. 164.528. User agrees to document such disclosures of PHI and information related to such disclosures as would be required for an entity subject to HIPAA to respond to a request by an individual for an accounting of disclosures of PHI in accordance with C.F.R. 164.528.
If User (or User’s Employer) receives a request, made on behalf of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, that User make User’s internal practices, books and records relating to the use and disclosures of PHI available to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the purposes of determining a Covered Entity's compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, then User (or User’s Employer) will promptly comply with the request.
28. No Resale. User agrees not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, transfer, rent or exploit for any purpose the use of or access to the Platform or any portion of the Platform.

29. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed in accordance with, and enforced under the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to its conflicts of law provision. User agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any Claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Platform, the Content, or this Agreement must be filed within (a) one year after such Claim or cause of action arose, or (b) the limitation on claims as provided for in the Employer’s service agreement with Provider, whichever earlier occurs, or be forever barred.

30. Notices. PROVIDER may provide notices to User via email, or through the Platform. Notice to the Employer shall constitute notice to each of the Employer’s employees. By registering with the Platform, PROVIDER reserves the right to contact User or User’s employees even after User and/or User’s employees are no longer receiving the Services.

User also agrees not to hold itself out as a representative, agent, or employee of PROVIDER and PROVIDER shall not be liable for any representation, act or omission made by User. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

32. Enforceability & Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement are rendered by judicial process or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and be enforced in accordance with its remaining terms. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

33. PROVIDER Is Not Responsible for Things PROVIDER Cannot Control.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Platform and the Services rely on third-party technology and services, such as application programming interfaces, for Third Party Services and web hosting services. Any change to the products or services offered by any of these third-party providers may materially and adversely affect, or entirely disable, User’s use of or access to the Platform and the Services. Likewise, PROVIDER cannot guarantee that any User data hosted on a third-party server will remain secure.

34. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between User and PROVIDER with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

35. Waiver. The failure of PROVIDER to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by PROVIDER.

36. Benefit and Assignment. This Agreement is intended for the sole benefit of PROVIDER and User and does not create any third party beneficiary rights. User may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, and any assignment shall be considered null and void.
