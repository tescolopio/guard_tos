Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, if Landlord shall fail to commence any repair obligations required under Section 7.4 above within thirty (30) days following Tenant’s written request for such repairs and thereafter complete such repairs with commercially reasonable due diligence, then Tenant may elect to make such repairs by complying with the following provisions of this 7.5. Before making any such repair, and following the expiration of the applicable period set forth above, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a notice for the need for such repair (“ Self Help Notice ”), which notice shall specifically advise Landlord that Tenant intends to exercise its self-help rights hereunder. Should Landlord fail, within five (5) business days following receipt of the Self-Help Notice (or within two (2) business days following written notice in the event of necessary emergency repairs), to commence the necessary repair (or to make other reasonable arrangements), then Tenant shall have the right to make such repair on behalf of Landlord so long as such repair is performed in strict compliance with all applicable Laws and restrictions of record and the total cost of such repair does not exceed an amount equal to two (2) months of Tenant’s then-current Base Rent. Any sums expended by Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph 7.5 without Landlord’s express written prior consent shall be at Tenant’s risk. Landlord agrees that Tenant will have access to areas of the Building outside the Premises to the extent necessary to perform the work contemplated by this Section 7.5. In the event Tenant properly takes such action in accordance with this Section 7.5, Tenant may utilize the services of any qualified contractor which normally and regularly performs similar work in comparable buildings in the area of the Project. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a reasonably detailed invoice together with reasonable supporting evidence of the costs reasonably and actually incurred in performing such repairs. Landlord shall either reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs of such repairs plus a fifteen percent (15%) administration fee within thirty (30) days following receipt of Tenant’s invoice for such costs or deliver a written objection stating with specificity the reasons Landlord disputes Tenant’s actions or the costs incurred. If Landlord delivers to Tenant, within such thirty (30) day period, a written objection to the payment of such invoice, setting forth Landlord’s reasons for its claim that such action did not have to be taken by Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Lease or that the charges are excessive (in which case Landlord shall pay the amount it contends would not have been excessive if the only objection is to the costs incurred), then Tenant shall not be entitled to offset any amount from rent, but as Tenant’s sole remedy, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section 21.26 of this Lease. Tenant shall be responsible for obtaining any necessary governmental permits before commencing the repair work. Tenant shall be liable for any damage, loss or injury resulting from said work.", "labels": {"binding_arbitration": 1.0, "class_action_waiver": 0.0, "jury_trial_waiver": 0.0, "venue_selection": 0.0}}
