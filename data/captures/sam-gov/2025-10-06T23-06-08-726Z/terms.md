# Terms of Use

SAM.gov is a federal government website. When you use this site, you must follow these terms. If you do not, you may lose access to SAM.gov and we may take other legal action.

All of the terms apply to you, even if they cover activities you don’t currently do or data you don’t currently use.

There are seven sets of terms.

1.  Changing Site Data
2.  Data Access
3.  Sensitive Data
4.  Privacy Policy

I accept the responsibility for the information and U.S. Federal Government system to which I am granted access and will not exceed my authorization level of system access. I understand that my access may be revoked or terminated for non-compliance with Government security policies. I accept responsibility to safeguard the information contained in these systems from unauthorized or inadvertent modification, disclosure, destruction, and use. I understand and accept that my use of the system and any API calls with my system account API key may be monitored as part of managing the system, protecting against unauthorized access and verifying security problems. I agree to notify the appropriate organization that issued my account(s) when access is no longer required.

#### **For Official Use Only (FOUO) Information**

You are allowed to use the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API for internal, U.S. Government business purposes. You are not allowed to display or disseminate outside the U.S. Government any values received in a Federal Hierarchy FOUO API response unless that value is directly associated with a Federal award record.

For financial assistance awards only, you are allowed to use the awarding and funding Activity Address Codes (AACs) submitted in association with a financial assistance award to derive the respective Office Name, Sub-Tier Agency Code, Sub-Tier Agency Name, Department/Independent Agency Code, and Department/Independent Agency Name from the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API. You may publicly display and disseminate the awarding and funding AACs, and the five specified Federal Hierarchy FOUO API-derived values from those AACs, in connection with the financial assistance awards.

You may not use the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API to build out a public view of either the partial or complete Federal Hierarchy. You must use the Federal Hierarchy Public API if you wish to display or disseminate the public-facing Department and Sub-Tier information.

You may not use the Entity Management FOUO API to build out a public view of the data. You must use the public version of any API if you wish to display or disseminate the public-facing data.

Some information in SAM.gov is sensitive. Public exposure of sensitive information could harm individual people, the U.S. government, national security, or all of these.

### **Viewing and using sensitive data**

Protect any sensitive data you view, download, or copy from SAM.gov.

When you delete or discard downloaded or copied data or printouts, make sure no one can access the deleted data and shred the paper.

Do not enter or upload classified information in the system.

If you put sensitive information where SAM.gov doesn’t ask for it, you are responsible for any public exposure of the information.

If you enter any sensitive information where it can be seen publicly, contact the [Federal Service Desk(link is external)](https://www.fsd.gov/gsafsd_sp "(opens in a new window)") immediately. If you are a federal user, also contact your own agency.

### **For Official Use Only (FOUO) and Sensitive Information**

If you are a federal user who can view FOUO and sensitive data

*   You may only use this data for your job.
*   If you no longer need access to the data, tell your agency to remove your role.
*   Only share this data with others who are also allowed to view and use it.
*   Do not share this data with contractors unless they have a written agreement as part of their active contract that allows them to view and use this data.
*   Comply with your agency’s privacy and information security training requirements.

Federal agencies that receive FOUO and sensitive data from SAM.gov may only put that data in systems that are compliant with the FISMA moderate standard.

### **Full Legal Language**

This system contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Individuals entering data into this system must only enter PII and/or CUI when it is specifically requested. Exposure of PII and/or CUI as a result of an individual inadvertently entering PII and/or CUI into a public data field where it is not required is the sole responsibility of the individual entering the data. Failure to follow these instructions may result in your record being deactivated. Individuals viewing, reproducing or disposing of this information are required to protect it in accordance with 32 CFR Part 2002 and GSA Order CIO 2103.2 CUI Policy.

### **Rules of Behavior**

Classified information may never be submitted into the system under any circumstances. In such cases that classified information is submitted, IAE and IAE security must immediately be notified and an incident file opened.

Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) may only be submitted as non-public information. In such case that CUI is submitted incorrectly, IAE must be notified immediately.

No submissions to SAM shall include malicious files, viruses, executable files, or any other code that would cause damage to SAM or other users who obtain data from SAM.

I understand that my system is only given access only to those domains to which my system require access in the performance of official duties. My system will not attempt to access areas of SAM my system is not authorized to access.

I will update my system account password and API key every 90 days in accordance with GSA security policy. Under no circumstances will I share my system account password or API key with other users or systems.

### **Non-Disclosure Agreement**

1.  To carry out the duties as the information dissemination (ID) source for the System for Award Management (SAM), the General Services Administration (GSA) may disclose information to authorized representatives of the United States (U.S.) Government.

2.  This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") covers information provided to the U.S. Government under a mandate for federal contractors as described in 48 CFR, Parts 204, 212, and 252 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134 and for federal assistance recipients under 2 CFR Part 180 and 2 CFR, Subtitle A, Chapter I, & Part 25. The disclosure of such information to the public, or those outside of the Government, shall be in accordance with all conditions and limitations set forth herein.
3.  The Data Receiver has a requirement(s) for such data to perform certain tasks on behalf of the U. S. Federal Government. Because of this requirement(s), the Data Receiver is considered "authorized" for the purpose of this Agreement.
4.  GSA hereby determines that disclosure of information is necessary so that the Data Receiver may perform the duties required of them by the U. S. Federal Government.
5.  GSA shall grant access to the information described for each year that a completed Non-Disclosure Agreement form is filled out, submitted, and approved. The Data Receiver may request termination of access or GSA may terminate access. This Non-Disclosure Agreement must be renewed each year.

The Data Receiver further acknowledges that the unauthorized use, disclosure or retention of the information may constitute a violation of the U.S. criminal laws, including provisions of sections 641, 793, 794, and 1905, title 18 U. S. Code, and that nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver by the U. S. of the right to prosecute for any statutory violation.

Limitation on Permissible Use of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. Data

This website has data supplied by third party information suppliers, including Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). For the purposes of the following limitation on permissible use of D&B data, which includes each entity's DUNS Number and its associated business information, "D&B Open Data" is defined as the following data elements: Legal Business Name, Street Address, City Name, State/Province Name, Country Name, County Code, State/Province Code, State/Province Abbreviation, ZIP/Postal Code, Country Name and Country Code.

D&B hereby grants you, the user, a license for a limited, non-exclusive right to use D&B Open Data within the limitations set forth herein. By using this website you agree that you shall not use D&B Open Data without giving written attribution to the source of such data (i.e., D&B) and shall not access, use or disseminate D&B Open Data in bulk (i.e., in amounts sufficient for use as an original source or as a substitute for the product and/or service being licensed hereunder).

Except for data elements identified above as D&B Open Data, under no circumstances are you authorized to use any other D&B data for commercial, resale or marketing purposes (e.g., identifying, quantifying, segmenting and/or analyzing customers and prospective customers). Systematic access (electronic harvesting) or extraction of content from the website, including the use of "bots" or "spiders," is prohibited. Federal government entities are authorized to use the D&B data for purposes of acquisition as defined in FAR 2.101 and for the purpose of managing Federal awards, including sub-awards, or reporting Federal award information.

GSA assumes no liability for the use of the D&B data once it is downloaded or accessed. D&B data is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The D&B data is the intellectual property of D&B. In no event will D&B or any third party information supplier be liable in any way with regard to the use of the D&B data. For more information about the scope of permissible use of D&B data licensed hereunder, please contact D&B at datause\_govt@dnb.com.
