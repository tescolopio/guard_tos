Our communities are largely public and anyone can see your profile, posts, and comments. We collect minimal information about you. We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If you want to just browse, you don’t need an account. If you want to create an account to participate in a subreddit, we don’t require you to give us your real name. We don’t track your precise location. You can even browse anonymously. You can share as much or as little about yourself as you want when using Reddit. We use data to make Reddit a better place. Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our Services, which are focused on allowing people to come together and form communities. We don’t sell your personal data to third parties, including data brokers. All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in select countries. Privacy rights are for everyone. At Reddit, anyone can request a copy of their data, account deletion, or information about our policies. If you have questions about how we use data, just ask. We’ve tried our best to make this as easy to understand as possible but sometimes privacy policies are still confusing. If you need help understanding this policy or anything about Reddit, just ask. Reddit Is a Public Platform Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account.

That content and information may also be available in search results on internet search engines like Google or in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You should take the public nature of the Services into consideration before posting. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely. Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, trophies and achievement badges, profile display name, about section, social links, avatar or profile image, moderator, contributor, and Reddit Premium status, communities you are active in, and how long you have been a member of the Services (your cake day). We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (for example, Tumblr, Facebook, and X).

Reddit also allows other third parties to access Reddit public content and information using Reddit’s developer services, including Reddit Embeds, our APIs, Developer Platform, and similar technologies. We limit third-party access to this content and aggregate information (for example, voting ratios) before sharing. We also require third parties to pay licensing fees for access to larger quantities of content and information. Reddit’s Developer Terms are our standard terms governing how these services are used by third parties. Please review our Public Content Policy for more information about how your public content is publicly available and accessible to anyone with access to the internet. What Information We Collect Information You Provide to Us We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes: Account Information You don’t need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account, your account will have a username, which you provide or which is automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to be related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on whether you register using an email address, Single Sign-On (SSO) feature (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a password, we may send you a SMS message for verification purposes.

Transactional Information If you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete your purchase.

We may also collect public blockchain data and addresses, such as when you purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or create a Reddit Vault.

This additional information is used and shared with our third-party payment and compliance providers to determine your eligibility to participate in the applicable Reddit Program, facilitate payments, and comply with law. Those providers and their services are subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. Information Collected by Third Parties Embedded Content Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don’t have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.

When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified. Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be: to help ensure user safety, or to protect against harmful content on our platform. Age Check Data is deleted immediately after your Age Check is complete. This helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules.

If you’re a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us. If we learn that we’ve collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we’ll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.

{"text": "I exercise choice regarding these technologies?”Cookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, Hashed Identifiers, and Resettable Device IdentifiersCookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.We may also create, use, and disclose hashed identifiers. As described above, hashing is a process of converting the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) that cannot, by itself, reveal your identity or contact information. If you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.Why Does Netflix Use These Technologies?We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and", "source": "platform_tos_netflix", "chunk_id": 20, "meta": {"platform": "netflix", "url": "https://help.netflix.com/legal/privacy", "doc_type": "Privacy Policy", "word_range": [5000, 5300], "word_count": 300}}

It is possible that some may interpret an ad supported subscription plan to fall within the meaning of a “financial incentive” for the purposes of the CCPA.If you choose an ad supported subscription plan, you will receive a discount in the price of your monthly subscription and when you watch shows and movies on Netflix, you will be presented Advertisements which may appear before, during, or after content viewed on Netflix. In certain circumstances some Netflix content and features (such as downloading and viewing Netflix content in other countries) may not be accessible under an ad supported subscription plan. If you would like to stop subscribing to an ad supported subscription plan, you can access the “Account” section of our website and select a different plan. The monthly fee associated with your Netflix subscription will likely increase if you do so. We believe the reduction in the monthly fee for participation in an ad supported subscription plan and our use of the categories of personal information described above to present relevant Advertisements to you represents a fair exchange to continue to provide members a high quality service at a lower price to members. When considering the extent of reduction in monthly fee for participating in an ad supported subscription plan, we considered projected ad revenue generated by all members projected to participate in an ad supported subscription plan and the overall revenue required by Netflix to operate and innovate its business, produce the Netflix content to entertain its members, and make a profit.Personal Information Rights under US State Privacy LawsThis section applies to residents of US States outside of California that have adopted US State", "source": "platform_tos_netflix", "chunk_id": 38, "meta": {"platform": "netflix", "url": "https://help.netflix.com/legal/privacy", "doc_type": "Privacy Policy", "word_range": [9500, 9800], "word_count": 300}}
