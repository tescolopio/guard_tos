Liability and warranty clauses revert to standard all-caps disclaimers that sharply limit monetary relief, and venue is fixed in New York courts, which may be impractical for users outside the U.S. Overall risk is moderate: privacy commitments are positive, but dispute resolution access and perpetual rights to user feedback warrant continued monitoring.",

Dispute options are tightly constrained by mandatory arbitration and class-action waivers, and change-management provisions allow rapid updates.

Combined venue+cap effectively achieves arbitration's goal (limiting liability exposure) through different mechanism",
        "Revenue Asymmetry vs Other Platforms: Unilateral monetization 'right' without creator entitlement contrasts models—Reddit Community Points/Contributor Program share ad revenue with karma holders, TikTok Creator Fund pays based on views, Twitch subscriptions/bits 50-70% creator share, Instagram Reels Bonus Program pays verified creators, Patreon/Substack/Medium Partner enable direct creator monetization. YouTube reserves right to profit from ALL content but compensates selectively via Partner Program (1K subs + 4K watch hours gate-keeping)",
        "Strike System Circumvention Trap: Community Guidelines Strikes section prohibits using 'another channel to circumvent these restrictions' with consequence 'material breach...Google reserves right to terminate your Google account' (not just YouTube). If Channel A gets strike limiting uploads/monetization, creating Channel B violates terms. Punishment escalates from YouTube-specific to entire Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Android). No statute of limitations on circumvention detection—old alternate channels remain indefinite liability",
        "Parental Liability for Minors Under 18: Users under 18 'represent that you have your parent or guardian's permission' (Section 2). Parents 'by allowing your child to use Service, you are subject to terms and responsible for your child's activity.' If 16-year-old uploads copyright infringing video, parent liable for indemnification defending YouTube from third-party claims including attorney's fees. Parent's Google account at risk if child circumvents strike via alternate channel. Parent's financial assets attachable for judgment/settlement. No parental control features in Terms themselves—only external Family Link references",
        "Incorporation by Reference Complexity: Agreement includes 'YouTube Community Guidelines and Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies which may be updated from time to time', 'Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising', 'YouTube Data Processing Terms except personal/household activities', 'YouTube Kids Privacy Notice', 'YouTube Partner Program' for monetization, 'Paid Memberships and Purchases' if applicable. Users must monitor 6+ separate policy documents for changes. 'Updated from time to time' creates moving target. Conflict rule not specified if contradictions arise",
        "Automated Content Analysis Consent Gap: Section 4 'we may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.' No explicit consent mechanism, no opt-out, no transparency about what analysis occurs, how data is used, who has access, retention period. Potential for analysis results used in ways beyond stated purpose (training AI models, providing to third parties, law enforcement without warrant). GDPR's automated decision-making protections (Article 22) may not apply if framed as 'necessary for performance of contract'",
        "Comparative Context to Prior Reviews: Apple 2009: 30/F, Reddit 2024: 35/F, YouTube 2023: 45/F progression suggests newer/updated terms slightly improve user protections but all remain Very Poor grade (F). Common threads: perpetual/indefinite content licenses, low liability caps ($100-$500), unlimited user indemnification asymmetry, California venue burden, short 1-year claim deadlines, unilateral termination rights, incorporation by reference to external policies, no arbitration but venue barriers equivalent. Improvements marginal: Reddit 30-day EEA change notice, YouTube $500 cap 5x higher than Reddit/Apple $100, YouTube no moral rights waiver vs Reddit irrevocable waiver. Core power imbalances persist across platforms and time periods"

        "Nonprofit Structure Produces Mixed Results: 65/D score demonstrates organizational incentives matter—removing advertising revenue, perpetual exploitation, monetization clauses yields 20-point improvement over YouTube (45/F). However, 35-point gap to 'good' protection (≥70/C) reveals nonprofit status insufficient—Foundation still deploys liability caps, venue restrictions, indemnification asymmetry, short claim deadlines prioritizing institutional interests.",
        "Transparency Paradox: Wikimedia excels at procedural transparency (30-day comment periods, 100+ translations, yellow highlighting critical sections) but substantive unfairness persists. Highlighting '$1,000 liability cap' makes users aware but does not cure inadequacy. Compare Reddit's dual-version strategy (EEA gets better terms)—Wikimedia treats all users equally but equally poorly on core legal protections.",
        "Creative Commons Licensing as Best Practice: CC BY-SA 4.0 + GFDL dual licensing single most user-protective provision among all reviewed documents. Users retain copyright, grant public permissions, content remains freely reusable by anyone, attribution required, copyleft prevents proprietary capture. Every platform should adopt CC licensing for user-generated content—eliminates exploitation potential while preserving business model.",
        "Community Governance Double-Edged Sword: Foundation 'rarely intervenes' empowers volunteers but also means no institutional accountability for community failures. Volunteer arbitrators impose indefinite bans based on subjective standards, limited appeal process, no judicial review. Editors can invest 15 years, suffer unjust ban, have no Foundation recourse if community sides with admin.",
        "497 Uncommon Terms—Highest Count: Exceeds Reddit (379), YouTube (297), Apple (328) due to Creative Commons complexity, DMCA safe harbor procedures, community governance terminology, 22 prohibited activities. Complexity reflects wiki-specific vulnerabilities and free licensing framework rather than corporate obfuscation, but still creates accessibility barrier for casual contributors.",
        "'Marketing Company Mediation' Rebranding Obscures Arbitration: Paid editing disputes subject to 'binding Med-Arb' where mediator becomes arbitrator—this is mandatory arbitration governed by FAA but terminology avoids negative connotations. Users lose jury trial, public court, class actions. Splitting costs equally unfair. Could weaponize against investigative journalists fact-checking Wikipedia.",
        "International Contributor Access Barrier: San Francisco County exclusive venue particularly harsh given 70%+ editors outside USA. English Wikipedia 100,000+ active editors from 190+ countries. Requiring SF litigation creates access-to-justice crisis—Indonesian contributor wrongfully banned must hire California attorney, international wire transfer, navigate U.S. procedures. Small $5K claim costs $10-20K. Foundation should adopt regional venue options.",
        "1-Year Statute vs. Data Breach Disclosure Delays: 'One year after...could have been discovered with reasonable diligence' may expire before users discover harm. Data breaches 6-18 month disclosure delays typical, wrongful termination effects compound gradually, algorithmic content filtering can go years before user realizes legitimate contributions deleted. Foundation should extend to 3 years minimum aligned with California personal injury statute.",
        "Paid Editing Disclosure vs. Journalism/Academia Complexity: Section 4 requires disclosure of 'employer, client, intended beneficiary, affiliation' for any compensated contribution. Intended to address 'Wikipedia for hire' industry but creates compliance burden for legitimate paid work: investigative journalists fact-checking articles, academic researchers grant-funded, Foundation staff personal edits, nonprofit employees (ACLU, EFF). Should create safe harbor for journalism/academia.",
        "$1,000 Liability Cap vs. $100M+ Foundation Resources: Wikimedia Endowment surpassed $100M in 2021, annual revenue $154M, $90M staff salaries, $40M reserves. Foundation has financial capacity to accept greater liability than $1,000 aggregate cap. Compare YouTube $500 (Google $2T parent), Reddit $100—all shield wealthy institutions from accountability. Nonprofit status does not justify inadequacy—should raise cap to $100,000 per claimant.",
        "Volunteer Labor Exploitation Masked by Mission: 'No compensation expectation' formalizes thousands of hours editing yields zero payment while Foundation raised $154M in 2020-21, paid staff $90M salaries. English Wikipedia ~120,000 active editors contributing ~2.5M hours monthly—volunteer labor sustains $150M+ nonprofit while contributors receive nothing. Should explore revenue-sharing models: micro-payments to top contributors, community grants, Wikipedia Pro subscriptions distributed to editors.",
        "Archival Mission vs. Reputational Permanence: Section 13 public contribution persistence means edits remain in page history forever with username attached even after account deletion/ban. Benefits encyclopedia (prevents content loss) but creates reputational permanence—youthful controversial edits follow indefinitely, mistakes live permanently, pseudonymous identity vulnerable to doxxing. Foundation should implement 'right to erasure' exceptions for: users under 18 at contribution time, content containing personal information disclosed before privacy awareness, contributions created under coercion."

Mistral AI achieves higher transparency than U.S. competitors but deploys transparency theater - extensive disclosures obscure structural exploitation. 55/F reflects: comprehensive framework undermined by opacity (-4.68 Flesch), discretion (approval gatekeeping), training extraction (perpetual licenses).

Liability is capped to amounts paid in the prior 12 months, functionally null for free users, and privacy disputes are compelled into arbitration—foreclosing public accountability.

However, coordination barriers limit effectiveness: (1) 50-demand threshold requires organized coordination, (2) 60-day window tight timeline (users discovering breach months later miss batch), (3) Same law firm requirement (individual pro se users NOT batched), (4) Similarity dispute submitted to arbitrator whose fees Pinterest pays (conflict of interest—arbitrator incentivized to split batches = higher fees).

      "overall_summary": "FamilySearch attains a 62/D—second only to Wikimedia (65/D) in this corpus—by forgoing arbitration and class waivers while providing unusually explicit disclosure of collaboration with commercial genealogical organizations. That surface transparency is undermined by an expansive perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license granting 'any and all purposes' use with derivative and downstream commercialization potential and no attribution duty. Combined with a functional $0 liability cap ('amount paid… if any') and Utah-only venue, enforcement pathways become economically irrational. Mandatory binary sex labeling and unrestricted sharing of living persons' genealogical data create privacy and representation risks. Nonprofit status does not materially restrain exploitation vectors introduced by sublicensing and derivative rights. Reform should focus on reversible or time-limited licensing, opt-outs for commercial data pooling, structured export guarantees, and minimum preservation/accountability commitments.",
